        "body": "I didn\u2019t originally share the recipe because I posted that late at night, just wanted to see some love for my cookies! Not a bot or with the AI slop, promise you. Here is the recipe though, since a lot of you clearly disliked the OG flair!\nINGREDIENTS\n- 1 cup (2 sticks/226g) of softened SALTED (this makes them so much better i swear!) butter\n- 1 cup (200g) of granulated sugar\n- 1 cup (200g) of dark brown sugar (chewier end product, can use 2 cups of white instead)\n- 2 room temperature eggs\n- 1 tbsp (15ml) vanilla extract\n- 3/4 cup (80g) of dutch-process cocoa powder\n- 2 cups (250g) of AP flour\n- 1/2 tsp (3g) salt\n- 1 tsp (5g) baking soda\nINSTRUCTIONS\n- Preheat the oven to 350*\n- Cream the butter in a bowl (i used a stand mixer), then add the sugar and cream till just combined\n- Add the eggs and vanilla, mix till lighter color and smoother, fluffier texture\n- In a separate bowl, mix the dry ingredients then slowly mix with the wet ingredients. DO NOT OVER MIX!!! The dough will be the same texture as the insides of a cooked fudgy brownie!\n- Scoop tablespoon ish sized balls onto a baking pan and bake for 10 minutes. I find that turning the pan halfway through results in a more even, beautiful bake!\n-Once baked, allow them to slightly cool on the pan, transfer to a wire rack once they easily come off the pan.\nThis makes about 35 cookies, they are delicious!",

I started during the pandemic from Dominique Ansels work and I\u2019ve made hundreds at home via at least 20 different recipes.\nOne trend I\u2019ve noticed in a recent revisiting of methods online is the insane amount of unnecessary work, safe guards and gate keeping of how difficult it is. Thermometer guns, precise measurements, relentless refrigeration between folds. Clair Saffitz has to be the worst in how she drones on about the difficulty, the endless babying of the process and the sheer number of steps added.\nIt\u2019s not hard. You make the dough, make a a butter block and enclose it in the dough. Roll it out, fold it. Roll it out, fold it. Sheet it, cut triangles, roll, proof and bake.  It\u2019s not that hard once you have the basics down.\nI\u2019m in no way affiliated with this dude, but search Yuval Croissant on YT and see the most effective, no nonsense process you will ever see and look at the results it produces (I used his exact technique for this picture).\nTLDR: try it if you\u2019re thinking about it.

Not just the tops. But I felt like I was already doing a lot.\nI used a dinosaur silicone mold to make the sugar cookies. The mold worked great for the gummy candies I made last month. Lots of detail. But I will never use a mold like that again for a candy melt cookie.

I can\u2019t knead in the stand mixer because it\u2019ll overheat (and after ten minutes of running, it didn\u2019t seem to do anything to my dough anyway). I can\u2019t use flour because the dough will get tough. I can\u2019t NOT use flour because it sticks so hard and so fully to the countertop that I have to peel it all up every two seconds. A silicone mat was even worse. How am I supposed to knead it? I\u2019ve even tried olive oil to grease the countertop but it only lasts about thirty seconds and I end up having to knead more than half a cup into my dough. So genuinely, can anyone tell me how you knead your dough?",

But, I would like to bake the cake layers and crumb coat it on Sunday evening and just leave the decorating for Monday.\nIs it okay to bake the 4 layers on Sunday afternoon, assemble the cake, crumb coat it, and let it sit (in the fridge I suppose) until Monday afternoon when I can ice it properly and decorate it? Will the cake dry out or the frosting change texture? Making it hard to re-ice and decorate??\nAnd does it matter what type of frosting I use when I\u2019m doing this method?? I planned to make white chocolate buttercream for the outside (I have to color it and make it look like the ocean) but she loves chocolate so I wanted the frosting between the layers and the crumb coat to be chocolate frosting.\nI\u2019m assuming this is normal but I really wanted to check before I messed up this cake and can\u2019t recover lol. Can you recommend the best way to store the crumb coated cake on Sunday overnight, and best way to store the finished cake from Monday to Wednesday??\nThank you \u2764\ufe0f",

Problem is, I don't know the name of the cake, nor the name of the baker, nor any of the ingredients. :D I don't really bake, I have maybe made 7 or 8 cakes in my life. I read about this cake online or in an ebook, so I hope to find it in an online search but NOTHING and it haunts me. It was a story about a chef who has become famous for this cake and people are asking about it so much that he calls it \"that damn cake\" or something of that sort. All I can remeber is that it has 3 layers: base, a filling and a topping, and one of them contains enough salt that you can actually taste it (I guess it was the filling, but I am not sure). I am 80 % certain its colors are on a pale spectrum, so not chocolate or anything like that. 55 % certain its topping is a meringe or something similar (as I don't bake, I don't even know the correct terms, sorry :D). 51 % certain the text contained something like the cake reminds him/eaters of the beach/ocean/surfing... And there it ends. Does that ring a bell for any of you?\nAnything of what I described could be wrong, so if you have an idea that doesn't check all the boxes, please pass it anlong.\nThanks a lot!",

We have some bananas going off so I asked him what he wants me to make with them and he said, \u201chmmmm\ud83e\udd14\u2026PUMPKIN CAKE!!\u201d. So I surprised him with it.\nIt\u2019s a pumpkin cake with cinnamon brown sugar streusel, cinnamon glaze, and pumpkin caramel sauce. It\u2019s delicious and is very coffee cake-ish.\nHere\u2019s the recipe for inquiring minds:\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0 and (optional) line a 9x13 cake pan with parchment paper.\nFor the streusel, mix these ingredients and set aside:\n\u20221/4 cup salted butter, melted\n\u20221/2 cup brown sugar\n\u20221/3 cup flour\n\u20221/2 tsp salt\n\u20221 tsp cinnamon\nFor the cake, cream together:\n\u202210 tbsp salted butter, softened\n\u20221 cup sugar\n\u20221/2 cup brown sugar\nThen, mix in until smooth and pale in color:\n\u20221 tsp vanilla extract\n\u20222 eggs\nThen mix in until just combined (it will circle, don\u2019t worry about it):\n\u20221/2 cup milk OR buttermilk\n\u20221 cup pumpkin pur\u00e9e (save the rest, it\u2019ll be used)\nThen, mix in until just combined (careful not to over mix):\n\u20222 1/4 cup all purpose flour\n\u20221 tbsp pumpkin pie spice OR cinnamon (your preference)\n\u20221 1/2 tsp baking POWDER\n\u20221/4 tsp baking SODA\n\u20221 tsp salt\nEvenly pour into the lined baking sheet, it will be thick, and generously top with the streusel mixture.\nBake for 30-40 minutes OR until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the middle. Allow to cool completely or until just warm.\nFor the pumpkin caramel sauce, add to a microwave safe bowl:\n\u20221/3 cup brown sugar\n\u20222 tbsp pumpkin pur\u00e9e\n\u20221 tbsp salted butter\n\u20221 tbsp heavy cream\n\u20221/2 tsp salt\n\u20221/2 tsp cinnamon\n*DO NOT TOUCH THE MIXTURE AFTER IT\u2019S MICROWAVED IT WILL BURN THE SHIT OUT OF YOU*\nMicrowave in 30 second increments, stirring in between each one, it will eventually thicken. I did it 4-5 times. It will bubble but just stir it really good and it\u2019ll come out fine. place in the fridge to chill while you\u2019re making your cinnamon glaze, this will also thicken it some.\nFor the cinnamon glaze, mix together and drizzle on top of the cake:\n\u20221 cup powdered sugar\n\u20221/2 tsp vanilla extract\n\u20222 tbsp heavy cream\n\u20221/2 tsp cinnamon\n\u20221/4 tsp salt\nThen, remove the pumpkin caramel from the fridge and drizzle it over top of the cake as well.

        "top_comment": "So, hopefully someone more knowledgeable about ratios will chime in here but that sounds like waaaay too much milk for the amount of shortening and sugar. Also, the texture seems like it\u2019s either not beat enough to emulsify the mixture or it got too warm and started to melt. Unfortunately I only really have experience with butter-based frostings, not shortening.\nHowever; it\u2019s crazy to me that this recipe has straight flour added to it. The ingredients kind of seem like an ermine frosting; but that method would involve cooking the flour with at least some of the sugar (if not all of it) and the milk in the pan until it\u2019s a custard-like consistency and then emulsifying that with the shortening/butter. It\u2019s also pretty much standard wisdom now that raw flour is a fairly bad e. Coli/salmonella risk, so you have to heat it to kill potential bacteria"

If you don't know the maker or are concerned it might scratch, I'd go with plastic, but if you know you have a nice one, it is more likely to be okay with metal.\nAnother option would be to find a metal pie dish that's roughly the same shape as yours to bake in, cut the pie and transfer it and serve it out of your nice ceramic pie dish."

It's been my go to recipe for a decade.\nHeat oven to 350F (191C)\nGrab your supplies:\nIngredients:\n2 3/4 cup (385g) flour\n2 sticks (8oz/226g) butter, room temperature\n1 1/2 cup (297g) light brown sugar\n1/2 cup (100g) sugar\n2 eggs (room temp)\n2 tsp (10ml) vanilla extract\n1 tsp (5ml) salt (preferably course sea salt)\n1 tsp (5ml) baking soda\n1 1/2 tsp (7.5ml) baking powder\n2 1/4 cups (18oz/510g) semi-sweet chocolate chips*\nHand mixer or stand mixer recommended for this recipe. Can be done by hand... good luck to you, brave friends mixing by hand.\n*most bags of chocolate chips come in 12oz bags. This recipe uses approximately 1.5 bags of chocolate chips. If you only have 12oz, still make the cookies, they'll just not be at their peak level of chocolatey-goodness. Carry on.\nCombine brown sugar, room temperature butter, and sugar in a large bowl. Mix for 2 minutes until fluffy\nNow add eggs + vanilla. Mix mix mix until combined (1 min).\nAdd baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Course sea salt gives the best pop of salty to sweet flavor in these cookies, but any salt works. I had pink himalayan salt on hand tonight. Toss it in and mix mix mix. (1 min)\nMix in flour 1/2 cup (70g) at a time. This batter will be THICK by the time you add the chocolate chips. My hand mixer usually reaches its capacity by the end of the flour and I mix in the chocolate chips by hand using ye olde wooden spoon. You are mere minutes from the best chocolate chip cookies of your life. If you've been mixing by hand this whole time BLESS YOUR HEART YOU ARE ALMOST DONE.\nDrop batter by the tablespoon onto a lined baking sheet. Bake for 12-13 minutes at 350. Cookies should be just browning along the edges. Let cool on the pan for 5 min before transferring to wire rack to cool.\nThis batch makes 48-60 cookies \ud83c\udf6a \ud83d\ude0b",

I've been trying to find a flour without any additives, non-enriched so to speak. It's near impossible. Some flours that claim to be additive free on Amazon sell for $19 per kg, which is not sustainable in the long run. Finally found Caputo, which on their website says all their flours are additive free. Read the labels from all sides, the only ingredient  listed is wheat. Found an Italian store with Italian imports, sent my husband to go get it this afternoon. Wouldn't you know it, on top of the 5 kg package of flour, there is a stamp that says Enriched, and lists all additives including folic acid. I am so mad. Like, is it additive free or not? It is imported, made in Italy, from Italian wheat. The producer's website says all flours are additive free. I don't know what to think anymore. Now I am stuck with 15 kg of flour. Does anyone know of a brand available in Canada that is FOR SURE additive free?",
        "top_comment": "With that Italian flour it was likely regulated to be enriched upon import otherwise it wouldn't be able to be sold here. This is going to happen to anything imported. If you bought straight from the manufacturer for personal use and did your own importing it wouldn't be subjected to the same laws but that requires a lot of unfun stuff and extra costs.\nAs for your dilemma I would search through alternative flour types. I used to be gluten free (elimination diet to find out digestive issue) and if I recall correctly none of them were enriched. I just checked bob's red mill 1to1 gluten free and it is not according to the ingredient label. Double check in person to be sure though. Gluten free won't be great for traditional pizza dough but you might be able to adjust some recipes to work."

I\u2019ve been going through around 65 lbs/month of flour, through various projects.\nI perfected my pizza dough over a month and a half of doing pizza 2-3 nights/week. I perfected my brownie recipe over the course of a month doing them twice per week. I\u2019ve come a long way on my sliced white and French breads. I have a pretty good start on my bread bowl recipe. I\u2019m only just getting started with brioche.\nToday, I decided I\u2019d start tackling cinnamon rolls. I spent a couple hours researching sweet doughs, and techniques. I did some math to work in what I\u2019ve learned in using duck fats in sweet recipes. I looked into which milks would help give me the texture I wanted to shoot towards, and settled on sweetened condensed milk, and buttermilk. I spent  over 4 hours going through the motions, completing the rituals that should render the product I\u2019m looking for.\nY\u2019all, I made what is now the single best tasting baked good I\u2019ve ever had. This cinnamon roll, this result of 7 hours of my day researching, measuring, mixing, kneading, waiting, flattening, filling, rolling, cutting, baking, icing, serving, and eating\u2026it was perfect. I would equate each bite to 5 minutes of childhood joy. My father-in-law compared it to his mother\u2019s, a rare compliment considering she was a ranchers wife and home-maker, and mother the of 6 kids who rarely left the kitchen. My wife says she\u2019s never tasted something that great. Out of 12 large cinnamon rolls, there were 4 left after we all finally decided we were done.\nDoes it get better? Did I just peak at cinnamon rolls? What are you guys doing to make your sweet rolls stand out? Recipe card will be incoming after I type it out tomorrow.",

        "top_comment": "Suggestion - if this is your first go around on cookies and you love the way the turned out; write down all the steps you took so you have them in mind the next time you make them. Such a big part of my baking is keeping my notes with things until I zero in on what I want and then I just follow those steps again, and again to try and keep my results consistent.\nYour pictures make it seem like you really nailed it for what you wanted. For the most part, they seem to be uniform in size - so they should all baked. The color is tan on the top, and the cross section shows a darker base so seems like you had a good time and temp for the bake. The chocolate chip count in the cookies both look good and well distributed.\nTo my eye, they look just a bit under baked (based on the cross section picture and the center / top of the cookie in the last picture). This isn't criticism but as an observation if you have dough in the refrigerator it is going to 'age' or 'mature' or hydrate - the liquid in your eggs and butter will better get pulled in to the flour, the longer the cookie dough rests. If you like them the way you have them, when you bake that 'aged' dough it might need fiddingly around a little bit to get that texture again.\nWith the idea you like these 'fresh out of the mixer' and since aging the dough even for an hour or so will help you get that texture of crisper edge and soft/cakey middle and  I what I'd suggest doing is a quick test when you're ready to bake more to make sure you're just as happy with the rest as you are these.\nMake three cookies - one baked at the same time / temp as this first time. Try it and if you're happy - bake them all off the same way, but if they don't seem as good as you want bake one more for a minute, or two less and see how you like that. If it still isn't quite right adjust the time again - add more time for something that is less gooy or even less time if it seems too done.\nA while back I typed up some other stuff in this\nthread\nthat might help if you're thinking you wanna start on the cookie path.\nGood luck with it!"

        "body": "Hi! Some of you may remember me from my post last year; \u201cI (15) made my dad a birthday cake!\u201d In which I made a cake with a gelatin pond and edible fish inside. This is the sequel to that in which I make another cake for my dad, with another year under my belt. Along with my dad being into nature and photography, he\u2019s a huge woodworker! In fact, last year was the first year in many that I made something other than a wood cake. This time, I totally stepped up my game and attempted things I had never done: square cakes and full fondant work.\nI started planning in December during winter break, and decided I wanted to re attempt fondant sculpting after thinking over my design. I spent a few hours going over possible choices, but knew I wanted to challenge myself. Fondant work scares me after over 7 years ago I tried marshmallow fondant and failed at sculpting. This time, I did my research on how to help fondant set harder. I bought satin ice fondant, which along with the clay sculpting classes I had taken in art class over the years, worked much better than in the past. Over the course of a week, I cut out the shapes of the hand plane, and waited for each piece to set hard before constructing it together. Then I brushed a luster dust mix over the bronze bits to give it that shine, and water over the wood handle and knob. I knew in order to successfully make the plane realistic, it would have to be size accurate. I decided I would model it after a lie-Nielsen #1, a plane perfect size for a cake. My original plan was to sneak to his shop with my moms help, and get real life measurements, but in the end I couldn\u2019t make it work so I had to use online measurements that I could find. (Only the blade width, body width, and length of the body.) this gave me a good idea to base it off, but still a little ambiguity on a few measurements. The wood block parts weren\u2019t that difficult, just time consuming. It mostly was just consisting of mixing colors together just enough to create the marble effect of wood. I ended up brushing watered down food coloring on some of the colors, because at one point it was giving more rock than wood.\nStats+common questions\nQ: what flavors are the cake?\nA: learning from critiques last year (boring cake flavors), I chose pumpkin spice and cinnamon buttercream. My dad loves these pumpkin muffins I make so I chose that.\nQ: reaction video?\nA: I\u2019ll try to post a video of his reaction later when I show him!\nQ: how did you attach the elements on the plane?\nA: the slip and score method used in clay work, aswell as making sure my plane parts were very hard and dry, then using an item to prop them up. At times I used some fresh fondant to attach them.\nQ:inspo?\nA: my inspiration is mainly the #1 plane by lie-Nielsen, and the version I used was the smooth bronze plane with cocobolo handles (the photos I used were from Jim bode\u2019s listing of a specific plane, last photo)\nQ: how long did this take?\nA: 14.5 hours over a week, 1 hour being in December, me sketching out my plans/the part stencils\nTotal weight: 12.1 lb or so, but my scale actually screamed at me and read \u201cover weight\u201d on the screen. So unconfirmed.\nYes I got very buff carrying this monster inside and outside as I usually put the cake in the outside fridge so the birthday person won\u2019t see it. My wrists hurt a lot.\nTotal fondant used: 2.7 lb\nSpecific/ fav details: the engravings of \u201cUSA\u201d \u201cLIE-NIELSEN x2\u201d and \u201cNO1\u201d also the cute little screws on the knob and handle.",

        "top_comment": "Here is the full recipe for you guys!\nIngredients:\nCherry Cake:\n200g Glace Cherries\n225g Self-Raising Flour\n175g Soften Butter/Baking Spread\n175g Caster Sugar\n50g Ground Almonds\n3 x Eggs\nZest of 1 Lemon\nDecoration:\n175g Icing Sugar\nJuice of 1 Lemon\n15g Flaked Almonds\n4 x Glace Cherries\nPre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas Mark 4. Cut the glace cherries into quarters and then rinse the glace cherries in a sieve under a tap to remove the syrup from the glace cherries. Then dry the glace cherries with kitchen roll.\nPlace the chopped glace cherries in a bowl and add 1 tablespoon of self-raising flour. Mix the glace cherries and flour together until the glace cherries are evenly coated with flour; this will help to prevent the glace cherries from sinking in the cherry cake mixture.\nIn a large mixing bowl, add the softened butter/baking spread, caster sugar, self-raising flour, ground almonds, eggs and lemon zest. Mix the ingredients until they are all evenly incorporated.\n4.\u00a0 Add the flour-coated glace cherries and fold into the cherry cake mixture.\nGrease a 23cm/9 inch round bunt tin (or savarin tin) with plenty of butter and pour the cherry cake mixture into the tin. Spread the cherry cake mixture evenly in the tin. Bake the cherry cake for 35-40 minutes.\nWhile the cherry cake is baking, place the flaked almonds in a pan and heat over medium heat. Keep the flaked almonds moving in the plan (this will help to prevent the almonds from burning). Toasted the flaked almonds till they are golden brown.\nAfter 35-40 minutes, the cake should be golden brown, and when a skewer is placed in the cherry cake, it should come out clean. Once the cherry is baked, leave the cake to cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes.\nWhile the cake is cooling, make the icing by placing the icing sugar and lemon juice in a bowl and mixing until a thick icing forms.\nDrizzle the icing over the cherry cake. I placed my icing into a piping bag to do this.\nSprinkle the flaked almonds over the cherry cake.\nCut the rest of the glace cherries into small pieces and scatter the glace cherries over the cherry cake.\nIf you want a full guide with pictures,\ncheck out it out here"

No air con in this house\nI baked this amazing sponge yesterday and cooled it off for a few hours at room temp. The bake was perfect and the texture was great. It was quite hot and humid but they cooked fine. The recipe said to store at room temp which I did. I trimmed and sliced the layers which left me with some scraps. The issue is that these scraps tasted off. I left the cake wrapped in glad wrap overnight but this morning tried another scrap and decided it\u2019s absorbing the moisture from the air. I have now placed them in the fridge because they are sticky and moist and taste disgusting so I\u2019m hopeful that they\u2019ll dry out slightly. I don\u2019t have time to remake it as I need to fill and chill the cake today but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anything that can be done? Should I stay up all night and make the cake all over again and risk it not being ready in time?",
        "top_comment": "Does it taste disgusting because its wet or is the taste just that bad. If its the lather then just rebake and check all ingredients for expiration dates and any problems. I don't think unless the outside of the scrapes is burnt that it would taste bad regardless of it wasn't stored the same as the cake. I don't believe the humidity of the environment would be that dramatic to impact this since its a cake and not an intricate dessert like crossiants but I maybe wrong"

We've had luck finding similar options of other ingredients in the Mexican section of our grocery store. so we thought this seemed similar to Creme de Leite and decided give it a try. Bought 2 cans on Feb 7th, 2026.\nThis is my FIRST TIME using this product.\nI opened the can on the left first, and immediately it didn't look like Creme de Leite. It's chunky, but also watery, gritty... It just looks weird and smells weird. I thought \"maybe that's just how it comes and I need to mix it really good\". Nope. I mixed it and it remained the same. I showed my husband, and even he made a face. Not it. Honestly I think it's maybe curdled? But I don't generally cook with this type of ingredient, so I'm not certain.\nI only need 1 can for my dish, but I bought 2, luckily. I opened the second can and, as you can see, immediately, without even mixing, I looks so much better. After I mixed it, it remained creamy and smooth. It still smells like the first can though, which worries me a little. Maybe this product just smells like that?\nThe strange thing is that looking at the codes on the bottom of the can tells me: They expire the same day (May 31, 2027), they're from the same batch, produced only 1 minute apart.\nDoes anyone have any insight as to what happened here? Should I use the second can? I'm thinking about getting a refund for the first one at least. Is this just a terrible product? Should I find another brand/option?\nTLDR: First time using canned table cream  and can #1 looks nasty, can #2 smells the same but looks better, what would you do.?",
        "top_comment": "This isn't an ingredient I'm familiar with either. The only thing I can think is that the first can got too hot at some point and it split. Either that, or the can was damaged in a way you didn't see so it was no longer air tight. Since they're the same batch, whatever happened occurred after they were put into cans\nEdit: didn't see that the smooth can has a weird smell. I guess it depends on what that weird smell is? I've had crema before, but I'm not sure if table cream is supposed to be the same thing or not. Crema tastes a lot like sour cream, so if the smell is kind of sour, that might be normal. If the smell is funky/cheesy, that's a sign of unexpected microbes and you shouldn't risk it"

The recipe used  almond flour and coconut flour, and a sugar substitute (I used granulated Lakanto monk fruit/erythritol - we don't like Stevia). It also had 1/4 C butter, 4 eggs, and sour cream, among other ingredients. While the cupcakes tasted 'O.K.' (they weren't great), the texture was coarse - almost like cornbread, and they were rather dry. \n  A week later, I tried a chocolate 'pan' cake (as opposed to a layer cake) recipe. This one also used almond flour and 4 eggs, and had 1/2 C butter. Since the cocoa I had was Dutch process, the recipe said to use baking powder instead of soda, which I did. Despite the claim in the recipe description of it being moist and flavorful - it was neither. This cake was even drier than the vanilla cupcakes, and didn't really have much flavor. \n   I'd like to make some chocolate cupcakes for Valentine's Day, but these recipes, as written, won't cut it. Can I add something - oil maybe - to make them more moist? Or has anybody had success with a low-carb chocolate cupcake recipe?",

        "body": "If you are a home baker that sells out of your home, i really need your help. Im sorry this is so long, i will truly appreciate you taking the time to read this. Please.\nI truly feel like my business is failing. I have lots of experience from a corporate bakery. I recently had a baby and decided to stay home with her. I have a passion for baking so wanted to create my own business and do it for fun at home. It\u2019s eventually scaled to a full fledged business now. Right now, I specialize in gourmet cookies. When I first started last fall I really got ahead of myself and jumped in without perfecting anything or finding what my pricing should be. I decided to only do a few flavors each week and rotate weekly. I thought it\u2019d be exciting and people liked the idea and I got lots of orders in the beginning. Mind you, my recipes were NOT perfected and needed work but also I was under pricing so much at the time.\nAfter a month or longer of rotating flavors I was realizing it was kind of hard for me to come up with three new recipes each week and perfect it and learn all three like the back of my hand every single week. It became hard and my cookies weren\u2019t consistent at all. So I made the business decision and made a business announcement on my socials that I will no longer be rotating flavors, that I want to bring a wider and more quantity to the menu so that way people have more to choose from and their favorites will always be available. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve worked on the last few months and perfected all 6 of my flavors. There\u2019s two other flavors I wanted to add making a total of 8 flavors at all times. And occasionally depending on season or holiday I would rotate seasonal items.\nIn the beginning, people would just message me or comment on Facebook to order. No upfront payment needed. They pay at pickup. When things started to pickup and get more legit, I made an ordering site. Where you preorder and see all my menu items, customize your order, and pay at checkout. The main reason I did this was to have all my information in one spot while making my bakery seem more professional and easier for me to have preorders in one place. Everyone was constantly asking my prices, how pick up works, what\u2019s on the menu on Facebook. Even if I post about it consistently! So I thought the website would be a good idea, all the info is in one place. How preorders work on there is they open Monday, close on Thursday. This allows me to prep during the week and prepare for orders. Pickups are on Fridays and Saturdays. To give my schedule more predictability since I have a baby, I only have one pickup window on those days. I go to a local community spot. People seem okay with that. I have pickups at 6 for Friday, and 12 on Saturday.\nI recently increased my pricing because in the beginning I underpriced everything so freaking badly. The more I perfect my skills and recipes, I realized I\u2019m underpaying myself like crazy. People understood and the people that do still order, don\u2019t seem to bother them at all. But the thing is, I don\u2019t get any orders at all anymore. Some weeks I get none. The weeks I do, it\u2019s like 1-3 orders. And most of it are my neighbors. Even before I changed my prices, I stopped getting many orders. My packaging and brand is absolutely beautiful and upscale. And truly, I may be biased but my cookies taste amazing. Every single person that tries them are blown away. I share all my posts and updates and content to my social accounts and share them to all local groups. So I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing wrong or how I can get over this rut.\nThis is my passion. I want to continue doing this. A couple things I was thinking was, what if people are bored because they expect the same thing every week now. There\u2019s no urgency to order because they know it\u2019s always going to be there. So with that idea came maybe instead of 8 flavors (which is a lot), to focus on 6. But 4 of them will be my top sellers and stay on the menu, and the other 2 I can rotate new or old flavors out weekly. That way people have something to look forward to weekly and have anticipation but also have a few of their favorites available. I also plan to open a bakery farmstand at my home in the spring. And offer lots of other baked goods that I specialize in and have a much bigger window for people to pickup on their own time. I feel like this could help a lot.\nAnother thing I thought is, what if people are just bored of cookies. Like no one wants cookies all the time or weekly. What if they want to see something new, so I made a poll and about 100 people voted for me to do cinnamon rolls. Which I plan to do. I also realize I don\u2019t have enough clientele to where I have a good amount of people rotating orders each week. I have done plenty of giveaways and took a few samples to businesses. I plan to do that more while also making flyers and take them to local neighborhoods. I know word of mouth is everything. If people don\u2019t know me or who they are buying from, they don\u2019t trust to order. I get it.\nSo do you all have any advice? What do you see by reading this I could do differently? If you were a customer, what kind of system would you like to see if you were buying? What would make you come back for more? I will appreciate all tips! And take as much criticism as you can give me.",
        "top_comment": "I\u2019m not a home baker, so please take my feedback however you choose, but for me your very limited pickup windows would turn me off. I believe your cookies are delicious, but I could drive to a bakery at my best convenience and pick up delicious cookies. I think that may be your main issue, you were able to grab a clientele because your offering was cheap and delicious, but not if it\u2019s expensive and delicious and inconvenient it may no longer be worth it?"

I used dry active yeast and didn\u2019t proof it before. Another thing that might have affected the product was I forgot to add the sugar until I was well into kneading and proceeded to add it after. I left the dough in a bowl covered with a towel in an oven to rise for 8 hours, and nothing happened at all!! I just went back and tested another yeast packet from the same strip, and it seemed to be fine. Where did I go wrong? Any advice is appreciated!!\nhttps://patijinich.com/conchas/",

I'm planning on giving out cookies to some of my friends on thursday but I'm afraid the cookie dough will be bad by then.",
        "top_comment": "You can typically keep cookie dough in the fridge for about 3 to 5 days before it starts to go bad. If you're worried about it lasting until Thursday, maybe freeze it instead. Freezing cookie dough works great and you can bake it directly from the freezer without much issue."

        "body": "Hi all!\nRecently I\u2019ve been experimenting with 15-minute, start-to-finish flatbreads and wanted to share what I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019m not a professional at all, just a teen who really loves baking (though I do study catering and hospitality if that makes me any more creditable!\nFor all of you that dont want to read my long ramblings of the experiments I did and how different things affect it there is a final recipe at the end of this post.\nI know that flatbread is probably pretty trivial and easy as far as bread making goes but it took me forever to master flatbread and wanted to share what I found anyway.\nFlour\nPlain flour works best when there\u2019s no real rise time. Bread flour has extra gluten, which makes the dough too elastic and harder to roll because the gluten doesn\u2019t get time to relax. Bread flour does work if that\u2019s all you have, just expect a bit more resistance when rolling.\nYeast: yes or no?\nI definitely recommend yeast. Flatbreads without yeast don\u2019t puff much and go hard and cracker-like very quickly. Yeasted flatbreads puff more and stay soft and flexible for much longer. Instant/active dried yeast is the easiest option.\nWater\nThere\u2019s no perfect amount because it depends on the flour, how dry it is, how long it\u2019s been sitting, etc. I usually add water gradually, mixing and feeling the dough as I go. As a rough guide, it\u2019s usually about 2/3 to 3/4 the volume of flour. Lukewarm water works best.\nKneading\nSince we aren\u2019t proving the dough, we don\u2019t want to knead much. Kneading develops gluten, and too much gluten makes the dough tight. That said, a little kneading is necessary to get a smooth, soft dough. About 2 to 3 minutes will do it.\nResting (very short prove)\nEven for a 15-minute flatbread, resting matters. Letting the dough sit for 5 to 10 minutes helps it relax, makes rolling easier, and massively improves puffing. No rest usually means flat, hard breads.\nI did try leaving it for a few hours once, and while it puffed slightly more and rolled thinner, the difference wasn\u2019t big enough to be worth the wait.\nRolling\nA lot of recipes say to roll the dough paper-thin, but I found that makes it harder to handle, easier to overcook, and more brittle. That works for tortilla-style breads, but if you want soft, flexible flatbreads, rolling to about pizza thickness works much better.\nCooking\nThis is the hardest part.\nThe pan needs to be very hot, but not so hot that the bread burns in seconds. I dry-fry these with no oil and always preheat the pan fully. Cooking in a cold pan stops them puffing.\nOn my induction hob (which goes to 9), 8 works best. As a general guide, use medium-high heat.\nThe bread should puff within about 30 seconds. When bubbles cover the surface, flip. The second side puffs almost immediately and only needs 10 to 20 seconds.\nThey stay soft while warm but firm up as they cool, so they\u2019re best eaten straight away (though wrapping them in foil keeps them warm for a bit).\nFinal 15-Minute Flatbread Recipe\nMakes 4 medium flatbreads, serves 2\nIngredients\n\u2022 1 cup plain flour\n\u2022 1 tsp active dried yeast\n\u2022 2/3 to 3/4 cup lukewarm water\nMethod\nMix the flour and yeast.\nAdd the water gradually until a soft dough forms.\nKnead lightly for 2 to 3 minutes until smooth.\nRest the dough for 5 to 10 minutes.\nDivide into 4 pieces and roll to pizza-like thickness.\nCook in a fully preheated, dry pan on medium-high heat until puffed and lightly spotted on both sides.\nEat warm for best results.",

Line 9x13\u201d pan with foil or parchment paper with overhangs for easy removal.\n\u2060Put cocoa powder, chopped chocolate, and espresso powder in a heat-proof bowl.\n\u2060Make brown butter: Melt butter in a light-colored saucepan over medium-low heat. Once foaming and spitting, stir and scrape bottom with a spatula every 10-15 seconds. Grainy white milk solids will begin to appear on the bottom. Continue for 5-10 minutes (go by senses, not time). When foam clears and spitting noises go silent, watch closely: The milk solids will toast in seconds. As soon as the solids turn brown and smell nutty, remove pan from heat so it doesn\u2019t burn.\n\u2060Immediately pour hot brown butter into prepared bowl, to bloom cocoa and melt chocolate. Stir until smooth. Set aside to cool.\n\u2060With a stand or hand mixer, whip sugars, vanilla, and eggs on medium-high until thick, smooth, fluffy, and lightened in color. For very moist, rich brownies, stop after 4-5 minutes. For slightly more height and fluff, whip 8-10 minutes until very thick and pale. (I did the lower end of the spectrum, 4-5 minutes\u2014I\u2019d recommend starting there.)\n\u2060Reduce speed to low. Slowly pour chocolate-butter mixture into egg foam mixture until incorporated.\n\u2060Using a spatula, fold in flour and salt until just incorporated. Fold in additional chocolate if using. Batter will be very thick.\n\u2060Scoop and spread batter evenly into prepared pan.\n\u2060Bake 25 minutes until surface is glossy and just set (not jiggly in center). Do not overbake. They will finish cooking as they cool.\n\u2060Let cool at least 30 minutes before removing from pan to slice.\nNOTES\n\u2022 \u2060White sugar + foaming eggs = fudgy centers with classic glossy, crackly tops. The thicker your egg foam, the glossier/cracklier your top crust.\n\u2022 \u2060Brown butter deepens flavor and evaporates excess water in the butter. If you don\u2019t want to brown the butter, melt it in a saucepan with the chopped chocolate, stirring until smooth. Pour over cocoa powder and espresso powder. Stir until smooth.\n\u2022 \u2060For extra thick brownies, use 8x8\u201d pan. Bake time will be a bit longer."

        "top_comment": "Using a LOT of colour on a baked good can be unappetizing to people - e.g. cakes with loud buttercream will mean you might be able to taste all the gel added/it changes the texture/people are concerned about how much food dye they ingest.\nI would suggest not trying to colour the cookie itself, and focus on getting a nice looking round cookie. When they come out of the oven and are still soft, often you can use a mug or small bowl, place it over the cookie and move it in a circle to shape the cookie into a nice round shape if it came out uneven.\nYou should also try to use a cookie that will be more flat when baked -- chocolate chip or similar will have a bumpier finish.\nFor a more polished look, use a simple cookie icing, like from Sally's Baking (it's just icing sugar, water, corn syrup + your gel colour and any flavourings)."

This time, it was black cacao powder and making caramel.\nI\u2019ve used the\nBaran Bakery Turtle Cake\nrecipe. A few notes on it - (1) I made 2 cakes and had around 600g of buttercream left over. (2) I would not follow the caramel-making technique in the recipe, just leave the sugar be without swirling it every couple of minutes, it\u2019s much more foolproof. Making it according to the recipe turned into crystallized sugar, which I saved by adding some water and a few drops of lemon juice. (3) The cake is very sweet, though the recipe insists not to reduce the sugar. However, it\u2019s a personal preference, I myself find American style buttercream too sweet.\nI really liked the deep notes of black cacao powder and coffee with a crunch of pecans. I hope colleagues and friends will enjoy it tomorrow :)",

        "top_comment": "As an 18 year old beginner? See if you can find something at an estate sale, flea market, or another secondhand option. As long as it runs, it'll be good enough to get you started! Once you start exploring beyond the basics, you may find that you want a mixer that's good at a particular thing, like a strong motor that's able to handle lots of stiff bread dough, or one that's particularly good at whipping up small amounts of egg white, for example. But just starting out, find a workhorse that isn't too expensive and see what you can learn with it. Happy baking!"

The raspberry flavor is incredibly intense and vibrant, and I absolutely love the texture. Combined with the crunchiness of the pistachio praline, it\u2019s such a beautiful contrast. I\u2019m a huge fan of this type of praline, the caramelized crunch paired with the deep, rich pistachio flavor is just so good.\nThat said, praline-making is still a bit of a struggle for me because of my blender situation. I own a Philips ProBlend 6 3D blender, but honestly, it\u2019s not great for nut pastes. I\u2019m currently using a cheaper multi chopper that does the job. I\u2019d love to know if any of you have recommendations for a blender that does a decent job with nut pastes. Right now, this step is always a bit painful.\nI\u2019m very happy with how everything turned out. This may be my favourite recipe so far! I hope you enjoy it, let me know what you think\nRecipe and step by step process\nhere",

        "top_comment": "I feel like vegans have the best handle on egg free baking. If you find simple basics without lots of specialty ingredients - they tend to seek out really novel flavors so if you don't want to spend $25 to make a brownie you might need to dig a bit but it's out there.\nRecipes designed from the ground up to be egg free will always work best. And you can usually use real butter, etc and de-vegan it.\nIf you like baking with banana and coconut oil you will find a lot of this in vegan baking. Bananas really help in egg free baking."

The flavor seemed pretty good, but my loaf was rather dense/flat.

If I try this recipe again, should I try adding in that amount of baking powder?

Same issue all year though, even in the summer, and this week we bought an Irish butter just out of curiosity and it softened on the counter within the hour and the land o lakes is still hard as a rock. So my question is, what's up with that? Why does that happen? Im going to switch to the Irish butter because I like buttered toast and I bake all the time and butter that actually softens makes all of that so much easier. Sorry if this isnt the right place to post this but im just confused and looking for some reason why it happens haha thanks for any help.",

I thought the batter volume seemed a little low and it was super thick, but didn't put 2+2 together until I went to make the mousse and the wrong number of eggs were in the bowl, by which time the \"cake\" (it's more like a sweet cracker now) had been in the oven for too long to reverse course.\nThe mousse came out good though.

I did a ton of research from this group and appreciate all the info I found through here!\nRecipes below:\nSource:\nhttps://preppykitchen.com/lemon-cake/#recipe\nLemon Cake Ingredients:\n2\u00bd cups all-purpose flour\n1\u00bd teaspoons baking powder\n\u00bd teaspoon baking soda\n\u00be teaspoon salt\n1 cup unsalted butter softened\n1\u00bd cups granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons lemon zest (about 2 lemons)\n3 large eggs room temperature\n1 cup low-fat buttermilk room temperature\n\u00bc cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\nInstructions For Lemon Cake:\n* Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly grease two 9-inch round cake pans with butter or baking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Wrap the outside of the cake pans with soaked fabric baking strips, if you\u2019d like. (This produces flat cake layers!)\n* In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\n* In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy. Add the sugar and lemon zest and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, scrape down the bowl between additions, and beat until well combined and fluffy.\n* In a liquid measuring cup, stir the buttermilk, lemon juice, and vanilla together.\n* With the mixer on low speed, add a third of the flour mixture followed by half of the buttermilk mixture. Continue, alternating between the flour and buttermilk, mixing just until combined. Stop and scrape down the bowl occasionally. Divide the batter among the prepared cake pans.\n* Bake for 28 to 30 minutes or until the center of the cakes are springy to the touch and the sides are just starting to pull away from the pan. Let the cakes cool in the pan for 15 minutes then invert and cool completely on a wire rack.\nFROSTING\nSource:\nhttps://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7556/lemon-cream-cheese-frosting/\nLemon Frosting Ingredients:\n2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened\n\u00bd cup butter\n4 tablespoons lemon juice\n4 teaspoons lemon zest\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n10 cups confectioners' sugar, or as needed\nNote: I made double amount to have extra to decorate the cake. Also ended up only using 4 cups confectioners' sugar to give it a somewhat sugary taste but still tangy.\nInstructions For Lemon Frosting:\nBeat cream cheese, butter, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy; gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until desired consistency is reached.\nBLUEBERRY COMPOTE\nSource: Google\nFor a compote that won't run between layers, use a recipe with cornstarch and butter. The butter adds a professional, glossy finish and helps the filling set firmly.\n* Prep time: 5 mins | Cook time: 10-15 mins\n* Ingredients:\n* 4 cups fresh or frozen blueberries\n* 2/3 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice\n* 3 tbsp cornstarch (mixed with 1/4 cup water to make a slurry)\n* 2 tbsp salted butter\n* 1.5 tsp vanilla extract\n* Instructions:\n* Combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, and butter in a saucepan over medium heat.\n* Stir constantly until sugar dissolves and berries begin to break down.\n* Once simmering, slowly whisk in the cornstarch slurry.\n* Simmer for about 5 minutes until thick and \"jelly-like.\"\n* Remove from heat, stir in vanilla, and cool completely before spreading on cake.",

This sometimes includes long (10 hour) flights.\nThe problem with packing her food is that there is basically no protein she will eat at room temp. She will eat meat, beans, yogurt, chickpeas, lots of protein-rich foods at home, but she won\u2019t eat them when they\u2019re packed. The result is that she then sometimes spends an entire long day of traveling eating carbs, fruits, and veggies, and then her stomach hurts (and on more than one occasion she\u2019s puked in the car post-flight on the way home).\nDoes anyone have suggestions for muffins that are higher protein (and also hopefully decently high in fat) that might fill her up some and keep her stomach stable?\nShe can\u2019t have any nuts, including peanuts, and she can have baked egg in muffins but not cooked egg (so something like omelette bites wouldn\u2019t work).",

After baking, poked all over with metal skewer to create holes for drizzle. Drizzle was made of icing sugar, juice from blood orange and lemon and Campari. Only thing I didn\u2019t follow from the recipe is that it cooked so fast I didn\u2019t get a chance to sprinkle poppy seeds and orange zest on top so after appplying the drizzle I added poppy seeds and zest and put back in the oven for 2 mins.

        "body": "Hello all! I really would actually appreciate any help so much. I have been buying this milk cream bread from these two Korean French bakeries in the US-Tour Les Jour & Paris Baguette!! For years, I have been saying it\u2019s time for me to replicate and make my own. Well, now is the time. The thing is, the bread is the most pillowy soft almost steamed like bun. Clearly, it\u2019s just a tad bit underbaked. I feel like the bun part I can do. I will be using the Tangzhong method and I will be putting milk powder in the buns as well. The part that I\u2019m struggling with, is the milk cream filling to be clear, this is not a bread that has the typical whipped cream filling. It\u2019s a milk cream. I feel like it\u2019s got some type of specific texture that I haven\u2019t been able to find in other places, almost cream cheese texture, but it\u2019s not cream cheese tasting, and not exactly as firm as it either. I\u2019m confused on whether to use condensed milk, milk powder, whole milk, whipping cream, cream cheese, mascarpone. Honestly, it could be just milk, which has been heated with cornstarch to produce that texture that I\u2019m talking about. I know the taste needs milk powder. So, any tips and tricks for helping me re-create this bread perfectly it would be phenomenal, thank you so much!!!",

While I would definitely use it for cookies and cakes etc I\u2019m thinking I\u2019d use it more for breads, cinnamon buns, and bagels. I tried to use my hand mixer to make bagels and I blew the motor so the last thing I\u2019d want to do is pay all that money for a stand mixer and then blow the motor or find out I can\u2019t use it for what I\u2019m hoping for. For those of you that have the tilt-head have you had any success with heavier doughs like bagels?

It's best to make that sort of cake as close to the time as it will be eaten as possible, or make the filling thicker and a smaller amount of it."

        "body": "Hello! So bit of background, I'm an experienced baker, I do cakes/cookies/desserts mostly for friends and family and sometimes take orders. I really only do buttercreams or cream cheese frosting for my cakes & cupcakes but my MIL always requests \"whipped cream topping\" for frosting. I did it for my SIL's bday with stabilized whipped cream (I think I used marscapone) and I hated how the decorations came out and the whipped cream still wilted significantly. She had also requested black roses which I had to make out of American buttercream to get the color and still have a stable frosting and it bled everywhere even with the white food coloring trick in both frostings.\nSo, now it's her bday and I suggested a few options and she requested her own, which of course, she wants \"whipped cream topping\" with decorations even though I did tell her on the last one I wouldn't do the whipped cream anymore especially with decorations.\nIt's important to note that she has a very very simple palette and does not eat or drink adventurously in the least - she was shocked that we at things like grilled octopus and a browned butter frosting blew her mind - so I'm not even sure that she knows what she's asking for. Asking her for further details will 100% not be helpful as I have done this in the past for many things. What I need is a recommendation for a stable frosting for decorating and icing a multi-layer cake that has the feeling of a whipped cream if that makes sense? Any suggestions (\naside from stabilized whipped cream please!\n) are appreciated!",
        "top_comment": "Just curious - have you tried other methods for stabilizing whipped cream? I use Oetker\u2019s Whip It and it works great, pipes beautifully and doesn\u2019t melt or weep. I\u2019ve not tried coloring it, though.\nI know that it may still not work for you, but I wanted to give you that data point.\nIn terms of alternates\u2026 if you don\u2019t want to use a commercial \u201cwhipped topping\u201d product, I don\u2019t have a recipe that tastes like whipped cream to me. This frosting is maybe the closest I\u2019ve got, but it\u2019s definitely a buttercream.\nhttps://sugargeekshow.com/easy-buttercream-frosting/\nIt\u2019s a GREAT frosting, I love it - maybe folding in some stabilized whipped cream could get it closer to what your MIL wants?"

        "body": "I want something that is a little funky and not generic, I want to make sure it appeals to a lot of people but I dont want it to be boring. I was looking for 70's themed birthday cake accessories and I found a lot of good ideas on reddit and online from sites like amazon and alibaba, and I was able to find some on etsy that I can use.\nI plan to use edible glitter, bright colors, edible glitter, and some hard candy disco balls that I am getting made. The cake is going to be a tiered cake because we have a lot of people so I get to choose a couple of different flavors and my client told me she wants one flavor that is funky and disco themed, the only thing I could think of is the confetti cake if you guys remember when we were kids that was really in, does anyone know any kind of flavor of cake that could be used as a good kind for a 70s disco themed birthday party? Oh yeah it was called funfetti I just remembered. Other than that what else could we do? Getting this professionally done, so please ideas can be as elaborate as you want it!",

I'm not sure what the word is, english is not my first language), and I was wondering, what is the best way to frost it ? I heard that swiss meringue buttercream are better than just regular buttercream, but I wanted to know if it was still easy to manipulate.\nAnd, in between layers, can I refrigerate it ?

I added way too much gel colouring as well and this was not the shade of pink I wanted \ud83e\udd72 I\u2019m wondering though if it\u2019s because the sprinkles melted and darkened the loaf? Anyway it tasted delicious!! Almost like a Hawaiian dinner roll but a little sour \ud83d\ude0d. Watch this space because I will be having another go at this! \ud83d\udc96\u2728\nIngredients: Bread Flour 550g, Warm Water 330g, Starter 120g, Sugar 40g, Salt 10g, Sprinkles 60g.\nInitial mix with everything but salt, let it sit for 45 mins and then add salt. Do 1st stretch and fold (really work the salt into the dough for 5mins). After an hour, take aliquot sample, add some sprinkles and do 2nd stretch and fold. Do another 2 more stretch and folds 30mins apart (adding more sprinkles).\nWhen bulk fermentation is complete, pre-shape the dough and bench rest for 20 minutes. Add a few more sprinkles while doing the final shaping and place in the refrigerator overnight.\nThe next morning preheat your oven to 230c for 45mins, bake for 45 mins (middle rack, lid on), lower to 210c and bake for 7mins (lower rack, lid off).

And after tasting the cake, I can say that was the absolute right decision \ud83d\ude05 in fact, next time I bake it, I'll reduce the amount a bit more since I want the frosting to be a tad tangier(?).\nBut the cake is really delicious and suuuuper moist and the frosting is great too!

        "body": "Background: A couple of months ago, when I was new(er) to baking, I made a batch of banana muffins. They came out pretty good...except, a couple of days after baking, they began tasting slightly soapy.\nI was puzzled as to why the taste took so long to emerge. Looking it up online, I saw comments about them being in the molds for too long (didn't happen with me) or too much baking soda (which seemed possible, but why would that not be evident until the third day?)\nI eventually figured it might've been the recipe I followed and didn't try using it again. And my bakes didn't have that issue after that, so I put it out of my mind.\nFast forward to the present: I was meeting a friend today (Saturday) and decided to bake a banana bread (above) to gift. It came out\ngorgeous\nand I was so happy...\nOnly for disaster to strike once it had cooled down for a few hours. There was that soapy taste again! I cut narrow slivers of the bread, repeatedly and desperately experimenting to see if I could isolate the cause. At first it seemed like the taste was at the edges - had I used too much baking soda that settled down at the bottom? But it wasn't consistent.\nI was starting to wonder if banana-flavoured things and I just weren't meant to be when it finally hit me - there was a problem with the chocolate chips I used, both in this bread and to top those muffins.\nTurns out, they'd been stored in the same shelf as some soap (rookie mistake, happened a long time ago) and it wasn't until they were baked that it became evident they'd absorbed some of the soap. I didn't taste it when I checked the chips a while back, so I simply had no idea. The muffins were only topped with the chips so the taste was much less noticeable there.\nThe rest of the bread was still delicious, but of course I couldn't gift my friend that.\nI was scrambling to come up with something else to bake (it was past 10pm on Friday) and managed some chocolate muffins instead. Thankfully they came out pretty good, and I was able to hand them over today.\nAnyway. All's well that ends well. I will now proceed to demolish the banana bread (after picking out the chocolate chips, of course.) And I now know that the banana bread and banana muffin recipes I followed were perfectly fine, actually.\nJust putting this out there as a warning to fellow baking noobs. Sometimes the most unexpected things can trip you up. The chocolate chips were well-sealed; never in a million years would I have imagined they'd absorb enough soap from the air to be able to effect something like this.",

I tried piping the leaves and flowers seperately onto a tray then freezing and adhering to the cupcake after they'd frozen, but they started melting practically as soon as they were taken out of the freezer.\nI know cream cheese is naturally a bit more like this compared to other frostings, but is there anything that could make it a bit better, apart from adding more icing sugar?

This will probably use around 8 gallons for these three, but we're stumped on what else we could make.\nEdit:\nSome people mentioned freezing the milk, but unfortunately that is not an option for us. Others have mentioned taking the milk to all kinds of shelters, food banks, and even other facilities. The latter we likely won't get permission for, as the closest facility (owned by the same company) is about an hour away, and it's unlikely that anyone would be willing to make the trip (we also need permission from the administrator and possibly hr). As for the former, while I would like to go this route and donate the milk, as previously stated, we would need permission, and I think it's highly unlikely that they would allow it, based off of previous experiences.\nThank you all for the suggestions!

That way it can scaled up or down or repeated as needed depending how much aquafaba you have:\nIngredients:\n1/4 cup aquafaba\n1/4 tsp cream of tartar \n4 tbsp caster sugar*\n1/2 tsp flavor extract \nGel coloring (optional)\nPreheat oven to 200F\nIn a stand mixer with whisk attachment , whip aquafaba for a few seconds until it gets frothy.\nAdd cream of tartar on top of froth, mix on slow speed until incorporated\nTurn mixer to high and left it go for 30 seconds. Then slowly begin to add sugar, one TBSP at a time over the next minute or so.\nWhip for a total of 5-6 minutes until you achieve stiff peaks and volume seems stable.\n(optional step) Stop mixing and add any gel coloring.  Mix until blended. Stop and scrape down sides to ensure even color.\nTurn mixer to slow and add extract, immediately turn back to high for 30 seconds.\nTransfer completely meringue to piping bag with preferred tip, pipe on parchment lined baking sheets.\nBake at 200f for 90 minutes.\nYield will vary - between 50-85 meringues. If you need a second tray, use middle and top racks, rotating at the 45 min mark.\nLeave on baking tray for 1-2 minutes when pulled from oven after 90 min to completely solidify.\n*if you do not have caster sugar, use granulated sugar run through a food processor, mini chopper, coffee mill, etc. Anything to get it smooth and smaller grains. You CAN use regular granulated sugar, but your meringues might be a bit grainy."

Butter or vegetable/olive oil is an absolute no-go.\nWhen summer comes up, I\u2019ll start hanging out with some of my friends again, and some of them only eat kosher which means dairy and meat cannot be mixed. Probably 95% of the recipes I use call for milk. How can I adjust so that everyone can eat together?",
        "top_comment": "for kosher specifically, the key is deciding if you want the cookies to be meat or pareve. if you bake with chicken or beef fat they are meat, which is still kosher but they cannot be eaten with dairy meals. if you want everyone to be able to eat them anytime, pareve is the safest route. in that case you can usually replace milk with water, brewed tea, juice, or even coffee, then rely on eggs and sugar for richness instead of dairy. most cookie recipes do not actually need milk for structure, it is often there for moisture. if you keep the liquid and fat amounts balanced, the texture will still work. eggs are pareve, so they are fine, and you can test small batches to dial it in without wasting ingredients."

        "top_comment": "Most people don\u2019t enjoy eating fondant.\nI have done a fondant cookie with homemade marshmallow fondant and people seemed to like that, but the premade varieties aren\u2019t as good.\nBut in general cookies with royal icing seem to be better-liked.\nALSO, remember that you don\u2019t have to do wedding favors at all. No issue with doing them if you want to, but it\u2019s not like people usually keep them. It\u2019s straight in the trash as soon as you get home."

Then bake it for 25 minutes at 375F, covering it after 20 minutes with foil if it is browning too much.\nNotes:\nBrioche is low on hydration (10-30%), very high on eggs (40%) and butter (40%) and just enough sugar (10%) for a hint of sweetness.\nKeep everything except the butter cold. The butter needs to be cool, NOT cold NOR warm; it has to be able to incorporate into the dough, but if it is too warm it will give a greasy dough.",

I want to perfect it before, so I'm going to bake it tomorrow. it is my first time baking this particular pie(I'm usually more biscuits, strudel, yeast-based recipes type of person) and second time baking a pie with stuff inside of it(and the first time was a catastrophe, though I insist that it was the quinces' fault), so I've got a bunch of questions:\n1)\nThe blind baking\nMy first time doing it-I found some informations about it, but there are so many opinions. Should I use paper parchment or aluminium foil?  And about the stuff inside-I don't really want to use beans since they would be unusable then, and I don't have any of the special ceramic weights-I came across suggestion to use sugar as the weight, and the article claimed I could then use it. Do you have any experience? Also, if I baked the sugar, can I then(after it cools) use it for the meringue? There is also a discord as to whether to remove the parchment/foil for a few minutes to brown the crust-I prefer crunchier, but I don't want it to be rock hard. The recipe says to bake for 15 minutes at 180 Celsius and then for 20 or 25 minutes with the baking paper removed.\n2)\nThe starch for the filling\nMy recipe says potato starch, but I also have seen cornstarch(but I don't have that one), and I considered using vanilla pudding. Can the potato starch influence the flavour negatively?\n3)\nMeringue\nThis one also worries me-the recipe says to use caster sugar(I think that is the English translation, the most basic of sugars)-so again, can I use the one from blind baking, or will it taste weird? And I don't have those fancy piping bags-can I just scoop it on the pie(with the cooled filling on top) and spread it out with a knife or spatula?\nSorry for the long post, and I'm sorry if my English isn't comprehensive(I don't know the English baking vocabulary).\nRecipe I go from is\nhere\n-it is in Czech, so you would have to use google translate or ask me, I'll try to translate it the best I can.",

Also if you are going to go with fake sugar, try using a artificial brown sugar replacement instead of just white. Truvia has a brown sugar one, personally I have tried the brown sugar Splenda BLEND (still some actual sugar). Brown and white sugar give you different results, so use the artificial sweetener replacement suitable to whatever your recipe actually calls for.\nAnother suggestion is perhaps only replacing some of the sugar instead of all.\nOverall, they don't look bad, how did they taste?"

Cupcakes, cookies, cupcakes and more cookies pretty much! :) and also, back then, a lot of us, my age and younger we ate the cookie dough that was prepared even though it could have caused us to be sick because the egg I believe was still raw..\nSo in my 20s, I became aware of the instant cookie dough that you can just take right off of an refrigerated piece of paper. I suppose, and then you just put it on the... cookie sheet ...baking pan...? \n:( \nSee?, I don't even know what to say. It's terrible. I feel like I'm glad we're not in the same room because I'd be blushing.\nSo i just stick it in the oven? Which I know is heresy? It's like, anyone here who likes to bake from scratch is probably cursing me out or saying tisk tisk? Well, sorry. I really need just a bit of guidance.\n I just bought the pre-made cookie dough and just asking for a bit of help for the baker who may come back. Can you please tell me what kind of pan I may need? A baking sheet right? If there's one in particular, because then I'll go buy it. And then I remember there may be something you spray on it?. I know because you don't want it to stick... So you guys can really hear that I have no vivid memories. \n Cupcakes, you have a cupcake tin, and you put in little paper things or the cookies I knew how to make, especially with different shapes and sizes because I had a little cutouts, and I already knew how. So guys, just consider me a complete novice. And any contribution would be greatly appreciated, because-- just think --this could be me tipping my toe back into the world.\n. I do want to take the plunge and try to bake. It would be kind of cool if it came out even a bit well. And this is, I know a bit of heresy because it's not homemade... its prepared dough. But if you could just give me the basics and something that I could even just look up in terms of pan and stuff like that.Thank you.\nAnd also this is my first time posting in your group. Would love to feel good vibes. .And I may just join which would be fun!",
        "top_comment": "You'll just need a flat pan with low/no edges. Cookie sheet, baking sheet - they're basically a different word for the same thing. Maybe there's some technicality, but I don't think it's important.\nIf your pan is non-stick/coated, it won't require parchment but you can use it if you want. If it's a pan without a coating, like an stainless steel/shiny pan, I would opt for parchment. I have never used spray/oil to grease a pan or parchment when baking cookies. So my opinion is that it's not necessary.\nI personally bake cookies on a non-stick 'airbake' pan, never use parchment, and nothing sticks. With certain types of cookies, I'll need to use a cookie spatula to loosen the cookie from the pan while they're still warm (not while they're hot). Basically, don't let the cookies completely cool on the pan. But even if that happens, they'll just be a little stuck. It'll still come off in one piece.\nSince you're using premade dough, there's a good chance they'll come out just fine. All you have to do is preheat the oven to the said temperature, put the cookie dough balls onto a cookie sheet evenly spaced apart, around 5cm/2in, and bake for the time stated.\nDepending on how you like your cookies (gooey or crisp), check on them after 10 minutes. If you want them to stay soft, remove them while they still appear a little underdone. They should continue to bake while they cool. If you bake them until they're golden brown in the oven, they'll be crispy when cooled.\nIf you're afraid of messing up, you can always bake one cookie and see how it turns out before baking the rest."

        "body": "(Recipe provided at the bottom of the body text)\nI recently put this recipe together and refined it based on everything that I want from a brownie (moist, chewy, dense, rich and somewhat complex chocolate flavor, and not overly sweet).\nI\u2019m not necessarily a stranger to baking, but I am typically more of a recipe follower, whereas this is one of the few times I have created a recipe and tweaked it to meet my expectations. So with that said, I apologize if the recipe itself has somewhat of an unusual format compared to what more experienced bakers on this sub might be used to; the recipe was intended for personal use so I formatted it in a way that made sense to me intuitively, but after having a lot of friends and family really enjoy the brownies and ask for the recipe, I thought it would be nice to share it here on the chance that others would be interested in brownies like this and/or a recipe for them that could be adapted to personal tastes.\nThe resulting brownies come out with the aforementioned targeted qualities, retain their moisture really well, and have a rich and complex chocolatey taste that is only subtly sweet compared to the almost excessive sweetness (in my opinion) of many other recipes or box mixes that I have tried in the past. While the top face/crust is a bit tougher than the rest of the brownie, it still ends up pretty soft and chewy after the brownies have been cut and placed in a sealed container to give the trapped moisture a chance to disperse more evenly.\nIf anyone has any questions about the recipe/process/ingredient choices, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will do my best to answer everything, just don\u2019t be too harsh since, as stated prior, I am far from an expert and only create recipes like this very infrequently lol. Furthermore, if anyone here decides to make them then please let me know how they turned out and how you liked them; I\u2019d love to hear what others have to say, good or bad, so long as any criticism is kept respectful.\nAnyways, I\u2019m not trying to write out my life story here or anything, so without further ado you will find the recipe provided below.\nSemi sweet brownies - moist, dense, and chewy.\nBaking dish: 8x8 inch Pyrex baking dish, parchment lined\nOven: 350\u00b0F\nPrep time: 10-15 minutes\nBake time: ~28 minutes\nWet ingredients:\n\u2022 6 tbsp salted butter, melted (I recommend Land O Lakes)\n\n\u2022 3 Tbsp olive oil (I recommend Terra Delyssa or similar)\n\n\u2022 2 large eggs\n\n\u2022 \u00be tsp vanilla extract\n\n\u2022 2 & 1/2 Tbsp milk\n\n\u2022 1 & 1/2 Tbsp strong dark coffee (I recommend Death Wish brewed bold)\nDry ingredients:\n\u2022 \u00bd cup granulated sugar\n\n\u2022 \u00bd cup light brown sugar, packed\n\n\u2022 \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-process (I recommend Ghirardelli Dutch-process)\n\n\u2022 \u2154 cup all-purpose flour\n\n\u2022 5/8 tsp cornstarch\n\n\u2022 3/8 tsp granulated salt\n\n\u2022 1/8 tsp baking powder\nNote: if using unsalted butter, adjust granulated salt to 5/8 tsp\nInstructions:\n1.    Prep: Heat oven to 350\u00b0F and line an 8x8 inch Pyrex baking dish with parchment paper.\n\n2.    Dry Mix: Add all of the dry ingredients into a bowl (excluding brown sugar) and whisk until no visible clumps remain, then add the brown sugar and whisk again.\n\n3.    Wet Mix: Add all of the wet ingredients into a different bowl (excluding eggs) and mix with a whisk or fork. Ensure the mix is room temperature to warm but not hot before adding in the eggs and mixing again.\n\n4.    Combine: Pour the wet mix into the dry mix then use a rubber scraper to ensure minimal liquid is left behind in the wet mix bowl, then whisk together until the batter reaches a smooth and thick consistency with no noticeable clumps.\nBake: Transfer the batter into the lined Pyrex dish using a scraper to ensure minimal loss, level the batter into the dish by tilting and surface smoothing with the scraper, then bake for 28 minutes.\nTest: Check the brownies at the 28 minute mark using a toothpick test in the center, then check near each corner ~1.5 inches in from the sides of the dish. If they are done baking, the toothpick will come out clean from all spots, otherwise bake for 2 more minutes and check again until it does.\nCool: Let the brownies cool until they reach room temperature (typically 2 - 2.5 hours), then put the lid on the dish or cover it with foil and refrigerate for 45 minutes.\nPortion: Pull the brownies out of the dish using the parchment, lay them top side down on a cutting board to peel away the parchment, then cut the brownies into the desired size and place them in sealed Tupperware for storage (ensures the brownies don\u2019t dry out).\nSoften: Let brownies come up to room temperature in Tupperware before eating. If the top is still slightly hard afterwards then let them sit for another 1-2 hours in the sealed Tupperware to allow the trapped moisture to disperse more evenly.\nNote: The brownies pair nicely with coffee, unsweetened tea, and milk (though they work well with pretty much any beverage of choice that\u2019s not overly sweet)",

        "top_comment": "Your best bet is to use marscapone not spreadable cream cheese . Otherwise, you can add gelatin to the cream cheese.  Bloom 1/2 teaspoon of gelatin over 1 tablespoon of cold water for 8 oz cream cheese. Then gently heat bloomed gelatin in the microwave 5 to 10 seconds until it is hot, but not at all boiling, stirring frequently .  Temper the gelatin by adding two tablespoons of cold cream. Then beat into the cream cheese.  Will stiffen in a hour or so."

It an orange loaf (?) type of cake and the \"point\" is for it to be SUPER fluffy and airy. This thing (originally) was like a foot high and really good. Since then she's tried making it 5 times and it never comes out right. The top comes out fluffy and airy, but the bottom is too dense. I'll add a picture of this below. For reference, the original cake rose to the top or even higher than the center tube of the pan and as you can see, this cake was well over an inch under.\nSome more info:\nthe first time she deviated from the recipe only by oiling the pan (instructions said not to) but it still came out great. she's tried both ways since and had the same bad result at the end\nthis recipe calls for separating yolks and whites (something like six eggs); I don't know if this is significant but she made it seem like it is?\nour oven is old and SUCKS. Not convection and doesn't hold temp consistently, takes a long time to heat back up especially after opening. Last time she baked this cake she made sure to keep the door closed the whole time\nkeep in mind despite all this, the cake came out perfectly the first time\nany help is appreciated\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j38d3datqwhg1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b2ca182f5b7409ef327458b42061a82cad695f3",

To add to my mild strife, my husband asked if I could make it with cream cheese, which he apparently adores almost as much as me. He has a stock pile of it. However, I have been scouring every recipe site, YouTube, etc and I haven't found a recipe that has one without the other. Any help is appreciated.",
        "top_comment": "Sweetened condensed milk thickens when you add an acid so that's kind of necessary for the standard recipe.\nHowever, cream cheese in a pie like this kind of takes care of itself - meaning it's fairly solid when cold. So it can be safely added to a lot of other recipes.\nIf you find a recipe that is cooked on the stovetop cream cheese will probably work.\nLook at this one:\nhttps://ninakneadstobake.com/key-lime-pie/\nI would GENTLY warm the milk and the cream cheese cut up, until it is smooth, and use that instead of milk and cream."

        "body": "I purchased a bag of tartaric acid because I love that zingy sour flavor thats found in a lot of treats like sour patch kids, blue raspberry flavorings, sweet tarts etc. I've even tried using it in plain carbonated water with a spritz of lemon & lime juice along with a dash of coconut extract & was surprised at how 'tropically tasty' & refreshing it is.\nMy original intent was to try & replicate that yummy blue raspberry flavor that's found in those classic 'blue treats' that I loved as a kid (ok, still love as an adult), but in cookie form.\nToday, I'm just starting out my 'experimentation stage' & upon doing further research I read that tartaric acid reactes to baking soda to make it rise more & that the soda neutralizes the sour taste unless you add a ratio of more acid than base to the mixture. I also use double acting baking powder which also contains sodium bicarbonate which would most likely neutralize the sour flavor even further.\nI'm also using stevia instead of sugar (I try to stay away from sugar in my diet due to health concerns). I also read that tartaric acid is sometimes used in stevia as a 'flavor correcter' giving it the perception of 'enhanced sweetness'.\nAgain, I'm looking for that sour patch taste so equal amounts of sour & sweet sound fine, but only if the other ingredients wouldn't weaken the flavor profile I'm looking for.\nIt appears that this phenomenon also applies to a recipe I found for 'sour patch kid cookies' where the candies are added to the cookie dough before baking, but it from what others have said, the sour taste from the candy also weakens after baking.\nWith all of that I was hoping for some advice as to the best way to use tartaric acid when trying to get that strong sweet tart taste I'm looking for in a cookie. I'm not sure if adding more tartaric acid to the cookie dough would do the trick (or how much to add) or if just sprinkling some on the tops of already baked cookies right out of the oven would be better. Any advice I can get would be very appreciated \ud83d\ude00",
        "top_comment": "There is definitely a balance to the acid vs base, where eventually adding more acid will increase the acidity because the base (baking soda) is used up, basically. So yes you can make something more acidic by adding more acid than can react with the base.\nIf you're interested, though, the acid they use in candy is usually citric acid, which is a more sour/tart acid than cream of tartar and you maybe could try rolling the cookies in a citric acid/sugar mixture, which is basically what is on the outside of sour candy anyway. You can get it on the Internet or sometimes hardware stores or somewhere that has stuff for canning."
