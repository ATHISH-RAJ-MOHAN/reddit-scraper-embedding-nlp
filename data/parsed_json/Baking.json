        "body": "I didn\u2019t originally share the recipe because I posted that late at night, just wanted to see some love for my cookies! Not a bot or with the AI slop, promise you. Here is the recipe though, since a lot of you clearly disliked the OG flair!\nINGREDIENTS\n- 1 cup (2 sticks/226g) of softened SALTED (this makes them so much better i swear!) butter\n- 1 cup (200g) of granulated sugar\n- 1 cup (200g) of dark brown sugar (chewier end product, can use 2 cups of white instead)\n- 2 room temperature eggs\n- 1 tbsp (15ml) vanilla extract\n- 3/4 cup (80g) of dutch-process cocoa powder\n- 2 cups (250g) of AP flour\n- 1/2 tsp (3g) salt\n- 1 tsp (5g) baking soda\nINSTRUCTIONS\n- Preheat the oven to 350*\n- Cream the butter in a bowl (i used a stand mixer), then add the sugar and cream till just combined\n- Add the eggs and vanilla, mix till lighter color and smoother, fluffier texture\n- In a separate bowl, mix the dry ingredients then slowly mix with the wet ingredients. DO NOT OVER MIX!!! The dough will be the same texture as the insides of a cooked fudgy brownie!\n- Scoop tablespoon ish sized balls onto a baking pan and bake for 10 minutes. I find that turning the pan halfway through results in a more even, beautiful bake!\n-Once baked, allow them to slightly cool on the pan, transfer to a wire rack once they easily come off the pan.\nThis makes about 35 cookies, they are delicious!"

Added 2 1/2ish tbps of crisco to thin it out. Think it was still a little thick. But the cookies on their own turned out very bland. So the extra flavor/sweetness from the candy melt was welcome.\nIf putting sprinkles on the candy melt of a cookie with this kind of rise, I think adding extra loose sprinkles to the tray they\u2019re hardening on and giving the tray a shake would help get sprinkles on the sides of the cookies too.  Not just the tops. But I felt like I was already doing a lot.\nI used a dinosaur silicone mold to make the sugar cookies. The mold worked great for the gummy candies I made last month. Lots of detail. But I will never use a mold like that again for a candy melt cookie. The process was way too time consuming for something that would\u2019ve gotten the same final detail results from a basic cookie cutter. (Last couple slides show the pre-candy melt cookies and the gummies).\nBut all in all a rawr-ing success."

We have some bananas going off so I asked him what he wants me to make with them and he said, \u201chmmmm\ud83e\udd14\u2026PUMPKIN CAKE!!\u201d. So I surprised him with it.\nIt\u2019s a pumpkin cake with cinnamon brown sugar streusel, cinnamon glaze, and pumpkin caramel sauce. It\u2019s delicious and is very coffee cake-ish.\nHere\u2019s the recipe for inquiring minds:\nPreheat the oven to 350\u00b0 and (optional) line a 9x13 cake pan with parchment paper.\nFor the streusel, mix these ingredients and set aside:\n\u20221/4 cup salted butter, melted\n\u20221/2 cup brown sugar\n\u20221/3 cup flour\n\u20221/2 tsp salt\n\u20221 tsp cinnamon\nFor the cake, cream together:\n\u202210 tbsp salted butter, softened\n\u20221 cup sugar\n\u20221/2 cup brown sugar\nThen, mix in until smooth and pale in color:\n\u20221 tsp vanilla extract\n\u20222 eggs\nThen mix in until just combined (it will circle, don\u2019t worry about it):\n\u20221/2 cup milk OR buttermilk\n\u20221 cup pumpkin pur\u00e9e (save the rest, it\u2019ll be used)\nThen, mix in until just combined (careful not to over mix):\n\u20222 1/4 cup all purpose flour\n\u20221 tbsp pumpkin pie spice OR cinnamon (your preference)\n\u20221 1/2 tsp baking POWDER\n\u20221/4 tsp baking SODA\n\u20221 tsp salt\nEvenly pour into the lined baking sheet, it will be thick, and generously top with the streusel mixture.\nBake for 30-40 minutes OR until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the middle. Allow to cool completely or until just warm.\nFor the pumpkin caramel sauce, add to a microwave safe bowl:\n\u20221/3 cup brown sugar\n\u20222 tbsp pumpkin pur\u00e9e\n\u20221 tbsp salted butter\n\u20221 tbsp heavy cream\n\u20221/2 tsp salt\n\u20221/2 tsp cinnamon\n*DO NOT TOUCH THE MIXTURE AFTER IT\u2019S MICROWAVED IT WILL BURN THE SHIT OUT OF YOU*\nMicrowave in 30 second increments, stirring in between each one, it will eventually thicken. I did it 4-5 times. It will bubble but just stir it really good and it\u2019ll come out fine. place in the fridge to chill while you\u2019re making your cinnamon glaze, this will also thicken it some.\nFor the cinnamon glaze, mix together and drizzle on top of the cake:\n\u20221 cup powdered sugar\n\u20221/2 tsp vanilla extract\n\u20222 tbsp heavy cream\n\u20221/2 tsp cinnamon\n\u20221/4 tsp salt\nThen, remove the pumpkin caramel from the fridge and drizzle it over top of the cake as well.

There's something meditative about kneading dough while the Sun comes up.\nThe house smells amazing by the time the family wakes up. Basic recipe I've been using:- 500g bread flour, 350g water (70% hydration), 100g active starter, 10g salt. Autolyse 30 min, stretch and fold every 30 min for 3 hours, cold proof overnight, bake in Dutch oven at 450\u00b0F. Results have been consistently good and appreciable.\nFellow early risers - what do you bake? I'm looking for other projects that work well with a 5:30 am start time."

I did try again (before analyzing so I didn't change much) and they turned out better but they still weren't like the ones I liked. They puffed up on the top and were very weak. When I was separating them the dough got thin and squished (didn't do that last last time) despite cooking for enough.\nThey have an overnight rise in the fridge then room temp for 1-1.5 hours.

It's been my go to recipe for a decade.\nHeat oven to 350F (191C)\nGrab your supplies:\nIngredients:\n2 3/4 cup (385g) flour\n2 sticks (8oz/226g) butter, room temperature\n1 1/2 cup (297g) light brown sugar\n1/2 cup (100g) sugar\n2 eggs (room temp)\n2 tsp (10ml) vanilla extract\n1 tsp (5ml) salt (preferably course sea salt)\n1 tsp (5ml) baking soda\n1 1/2 tsp (7.5ml) baking powder\n2 1/4 cups (18oz/510g) semi-sweet chocolate chips*\nHand mixer or stand mixer recommended for this recipe. Can be done by hand... good luck to you, brave friends mixing by hand.\n*most bags of chocolate chips come in 12oz bags. This recipe uses approximately 1.5 bags of chocolate chips. If you only have 12oz, still make the cookies, they'll just not be at their peak level of chocolatey-goodness. Carry on.\nCombine brown sugar, room temperature butter, and sugar in a large bowl. Mix for 2 minutes until fluffy\nNow add eggs + vanilla. Mix mix mix until combined (1 min).\nAdd baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Course sea salt gives the best pop of salty to sweet flavor in these cookies, but any salt works. I had pink himalayan salt on hand tonight. Toss it in and mix mix mix. (1 min)\nMix in flour 1/2 cup (70g) at a time. This batter will be THICK by the time you add the chocolate chips. My hand mixer usually reaches its capacity by the end of the flour and I mix in the chocolate chips by hand using ye olde wooden spoon. You are mere minutes from the best chocolate chip cookies of your life. If you've been mixing by hand this whole time BLESS YOUR HEART YOU ARE ALMOST DONE.\nDrop batter by the tablespoon onto a lined baking sheet. Bake for 12-13 minutes at 350. Cookies should be just browning along the edges. Let cool on the pan for 5 min before transferring to wire rack to cool.\nThis batch makes 48-60 cookies \ud83c\udf6a \ud83d\ude0b"

I\u2019m trying to better understand the best way to replicate that type of coating.\nWould you all recommend purchasing NSA chocolate wafers and adjusting sweetness (for example, with sucralose), or is there a better approach? Also would tempering this be easy? Sorry I have no idea what i'm doing, I just need to get some sales before I can afford manufacturing.\nAny expertise would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

Some flours that claim to be additive free on Amazon sell for $19 per kg, which is not sustainable in the long run. Finally found Caputo, which on their website says all their flours are additive free. Read the labels from all sides, the only ingredient  listed is wheat. Found an Italian store with Italian imports, sent my husband to go get it this afternoon. Wouldn't you know it, on top of the 5 kg package of flour, there is a stamp that says Enriched, and lists all additives including folic acid. I am so mad. Like, is it additive free or not? It is imported, made in Italy, from Italian wheat. The producer's website says all flours are additive free. I don't know what to think anymore. Now I am stuck with 15 kg of flour. Does anyone know of a brand available in Canada that is FOR SURE additive free?"

Since I left the kitchen, I\u2019ve been playing with recipes in ways no restaurant owners would ever let me. About 3 months ago, I started my journey into baking. I\u2019ve been going through around 65 lbs/month of flour, through various projects.\nI perfected my pizza dough over a month and a half of doing pizza 2-3 nights/week. I perfected my brownie recipe over the course of a month doing them twice per week. I\u2019ve come a long way on my sliced white and French breads. I have a pretty good start on my bread bowl recipe. I\u2019m only just getting started with brioche.\nToday, I decided I\u2019d start tackling cinnamon rolls. I spent a couple hours researching sweet doughs, and techniques. I did some math to work in what I\u2019ve learned in using duck fats in sweet recipes. I looked into which milks would help give me the texture I wanted to shoot towards, and settled on sweetened condensed milk, and buttermilk. I spent  over 4 hours going through the motions, completing the rituals that should render the product I\u2019m looking for.\nY\u2019all, I made what is now the single best tasting baked good I\u2019ve ever had. This cinnamon roll, this result of 7 hours of my day researching, measuring, mixing, kneading, waiting, flattening, filling, rolling, cutting, baking, icing, serving, and eating\u2026it was perfect. I would equate each bite to 5 minutes of childhood joy. My father-in-law compared it to his mother\u2019s, a rare compliment considering she was a ranchers wife and home-maker, and mother the of 6 kids who rarely left the kitchen. My wife says she\u2019s never tasted something that great. Out of 12 large cinnamon rolls, there were 4 left after we all finally decided we were done.\nDoes it get better? Did I just peak at cinnamon rolls? What are you guys doing to make your sweet rolls stand out? Recipe card will be incoming after I type it out tomorrow."

        "body": "Hi! Some of you may remember me from my post last year; \u201cI (15) made my dad a birthday cake!\u201d In which I made a cake with a gelatin pond and edible fish inside. This is the sequel to that in which I make another cake for my dad, with another year under my belt. Along with my dad being into nature and photography, he\u2019s a huge woodworker! In fact, last year was the first year in many that I made something other than a wood cake. This time, I totally stepped up my game and attempted things I had never done: square cakes and full fondant work.\nI started planning in December during winter break, and decided I wanted to re attempt fondant sculpting after thinking over my design. I spent a few hours going over possible choices, but knew I wanted to challenge myself. Fondant work scares me after over 7 years ago I tried marshmallow fondant and failed at sculpting. This time, I did my research on how to help fondant set harder. I bought satin ice fondant, which along with the clay sculpting classes I had taken in art class over the years, worked much better than in the past. Over the course of a week, I cut out the shapes of the hand plane, and waited for each piece to set hard before constructing it together. Then I brushed a luster dust mix over the bronze bits to give it that shine, and water over the wood handle and knob. I knew in order to successfully make the plane realistic, it would have to be size accurate. I decided I would model it after a lie-Nielsen #1, a plane perfect size for a cake. My original plan was to sneak to his shop with my moms help, and get real life measurements, but in the end I couldn\u2019t make it work so I had to use online measurements that I could find. (Only the blade width, body width, and length of the body.) this gave me a good idea to base it off, but still a little ambiguity on a few measurements. The wood block parts weren\u2019t that difficult, just time consuming. It mostly was just consisting of mixing colors together just enough to create the marble effect of wood. I ended up brushing watered down food coloring on some of the colors, because at one point it was giving more rock than wood.\nStats+common questions\nQ: what flavors are the cake?\nA: learning from critiques last year (boring cake flavors), I chose pumpkin spice and cinnamon buttercream. My dad loves these pumpkin muffins I make so I chose that.\nQ: reaction video?\nA: I\u2019ll try to post a video of his reaction later when I show him!\nQ: how did you attach the elements on the plane?\nA: the slip and score method used in clay work, aswell as making sure my plane parts were very hard and dry, then using an item to prop them up. At times I used some fresh fondant to attach them.\nQ:inspo?\nA: my inspiration is mainly the #1 plane by lie-Nielsen, and the version I used was the smooth bronze plane with cocobolo handles (the photos I used were from Jim bode\u2019s listing of a specific plane, last photo)\nQ: how long did this take?\nA: 14.5 hours over a week, 1 hour being in December, me sketching out my plans/the part stencils\nTotal weight: 12.1 lb or so, but my scale actually screamed at me and read \u201cover weight\u201d on the screen. So unconfirmed.\nYes I got very buff carrying this monster inside and outside as I usually put the cake in the outside fridge so the birthday person won\u2019t see it. My wrists hurt a lot.\nTotal fondant used: 2.7 lb\nSpecific/ fav details: the engravings of \u201cUSA\u201d \u201cLIE-NIELSEN x2\u201d and \u201cNO1\u201d also the cute little screws on the knob and handle."

I have work until 6pm the day prior and ill probably be tired as hell.\npreferably something that is like cupcakes where I can give it to people without having to cut something, and if possible not refrigerated\nI want something intermediately complex, not 1000 steps+ ingredients but not something that takes 30 minutes because the gift to myself is having a relaxing time to bake\nalso im perfectly okay with buying ingredients I just cant spend like $20 on a single use thing yk?\nI know these are fairly vague guidelines, honestly hoping that makes it easier to recieve a wide variety of options to choose from-\nthank yall in advance!!"

They were yeasty raised donuts sprinkled in granulated sugar and the dough its self was so flavorful that they were enough with that simplicity. They didn\u2019t need to be smothered with gloopy overly sweet frosting. I\u2019ve tried several recipes for a raised donuts I\u2019ve found online and they fall so flat. One from King Arthur, one from NYT, and they are one dimensional. The bread has zero flavor.\nI\u2019m not looking for \u201clight as air\u201d these were more substantial. They had more crispy texture to the outside and while not chewy they also weren\u2019t exactly delicate. And they definitely had a yeasty flavor but that wasn\u2019t all, also more complex bready flavors. Help a girl out bakers!\nHow do I get a more flavorful raised donut?\nI used this recipe most recently and was underwhelmed:\nhttps://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/yeast-raised-doughnuts-recipe"

Truly 10/10 every single time, so I decided to start making varieties like white chocolate chip and Oreo. I thought, why not add a Oreo buttercream frosting to the Oreo one to spice things up a little. It\u2019s really delicious!\nHowever\u2026 I used a piping bag to pipe the buttercream on, and well clearly the frosting is brown, so you can imagine how it looks. Fresh pile of turd to put it politely. I didn\u2019t get a photo because no one needs to see it. But imagine a poo emoji. So I flattened it down, as pictured.\nSooo..  cookie makers who put on frosting (like crumbl style) - do you have any tips?\nAdded other pictures of my bakes because why not! Let me know if you want any recipes"

Then looked in the description and it was all garbage. But the guy isn't an english speaker so he may have just badly translated stuff. Then looked at the thumbnails.\nShit, it's AI.\nI didn't want to back down so I just finished the things.\nThe thing is, the recipe is for crossiants, as stated before. The recipe calls for no yeast, no salt. Sure, I've seen recipes with no salt, but I've never seen a recipe with no yeast so maybe that should have been a major red flag.\nIt feels like i'm just eating flavorless dough with chocolate in it. I'm actually so mad. I basically wasted five hours. That's not bad in the grand scheme of things but they were going to be a gift for a birthday. I'm not giving those away. And I don't even like them either so again, I wasted five hours.\nHere are screenshots of the guys thumbnail and like, part of the recipe I used.\nEdit: Okay, I can't read. There is salt.

We've had luck finding similar options of other ingredients in the Mexican section of our grocery store. so we thought this seemed similar to Creme de Leite and decided give it a try. Bought 2 cans on Feb 7th, 2026.\nThis is my FIRST TIME using this product.\nI opened the can on the left first, and immediately it didn't look like Creme de Leite. It's chunky, but also watery, gritty... It just looks weird and smells weird. I thought \"maybe that's just how it comes and I need to mix it really good\". Nope. I mixed it and it remained the same. I showed my husband, and even he made a face. Not it. Honestly I think it's maybe curdled? But I don't generally cook with this type of ingredient, so I'm not certain.\nI only need 1 can for my dish, but I bought 2, luckily. I opened the second can and, as you can see, immediately, without even mixing, I looks so much better. After I mixed it, it remained creamy and smooth. It still smells like the first can though, which worries me a little. Maybe this product just smells like that?\nThe strange thing is that looking at the codes on the bottom of the can tells me: They expire the same day (May 31, 2027), they're from the same batch, produced only 1 minute apart.\nDoes anyone have any insight as to what happened here? Should I use the second can? I'm thinking about getting a refund for the first one at least. Is this just a terrible product? Should I find another brand/option?\nTLDR: First time using canned table cream  and can #1 looks nasty, can #2 smells the same but looks better, what would you do.?"

They didn't become uncomfortably long and dense, though they did collapse a little into a wider shape.

The recipe used  almond flour and coconut flour, and a sugar substitute (I used granulated Lakanto monk fruit/erythritol - we don't like Stevia). It also had 1/4 C butter, 4 eggs, and sour cream, among other ingredients. While the cupcakes tasted 'O.K.' (they weren't great), the texture was coarse - almost like cornbread, and they were rather dry. \n  A week later, I tried a chocolate 'pan' cake (as opposed to a layer cake) recipe. This one also used almond flour and 4 eggs, and had 1/2 C butter. Since the cocoa I had was Dutch process, the recipe said to use baking powder instead of soda, which I did. Despite the claim in the recipe description of it being moist and flavorful - it was neither. This cake was even drier than the vanilla cupcakes, and didn't really have much flavor. \n   I'd like to make some chocolate cupcakes for Valentine's Day, but these recipes, as written, won't cut it. Can I add something - oil maybe - to make them more moist? Or has anybody had success with a low-carb chocolate cupcake recipe?"

        "body": "If you are a home baker that sells out of your home, i really need your help. Im sorry this is so long, i will truly appreciate you taking the time to read this. Please.\nI truly feel like my business is failing. I have lots of experience from a corporate bakery. I recently had a baby and decided to stay home with her. I have a passion for baking so wanted to create my own business and do it for fun at home. It\u2019s eventually scaled to a full fledged business now. Right now, I specialize in gourmet cookies. When I first started last fall I really got ahead of myself and jumped in without perfecting anything or finding what my pricing should be. I decided to only do a few flavors each week and rotate weekly. I thought it\u2019d be exciting and people liked the idea and I got lots of orders in the beginning. Mind you, my recipes were NOT perfected and needed work but also I was under pricing so much at the time.\nAfter a month or longer of rotating flavors I was realizing it was kind of hard for me to come up with three new recipes each week and perfect it and learn all three like the back of my hand every single week. It became hard and my cookies weren\u2019t consistent at all. So I made the business decision and made a business announcement on my socials that I will no longer be rotating flavors, that I want to bring a wider and more quantity to the menu so that way people have more to choose from and their favorites will always be available. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve worked on the last few months and perfected all 6 of my flavors. There\u2019s two other flavors I wanted to add making a total of 8 flavors at all times. And occasionally depending on season or holiday I would rotate seasonal items.\nIn the beginning, people would just message me or comment on Facebook to order. No upfront payment needed. They pay at pickup. When things started to pickup and get more legit, I made an ordering site. Where you preorder and see all my menu items, customize your order, and pay at checkout. The main reason I did this was to have all my information in one spot while making my bakery seem more professional and easier for me to have preorders in one place. Everyone was constantly asking my prices, how pick up works, what\u2019s on the menu on Facebook. Even if I post about it consistently! So I thought the website would be a good idea, all the info is in one place. How preorders work on there is they open Monday, close on Thursday. This allows me to prep during the week and prepare for orders. Pickups are on Fridays and Saturdays. To give my schedule more predictability since I have a baby, I only have one pickup window on those days. I go to a local community spot. People seem okay with that. I have pickups at 6 for Friday, and 12 on Saturday.\nI recently increased my pricing because in the beginning I underpriced everything so freaking badly. The more I perfect my skills and recipes, I realized I\u2019m underpaying myself like crazy. People understood and the people that do still order, don\u2019t seem to bother them at all. But the thing is, I don\u2019t get any orders at all anymore. Some weeks I get none. The weeks I do, it\u2019s like 1-3 orders. And most of it are my neighbors. Even before I changed my prices, I stopped getting many orders. My packaging and brand is absolutely beautiful and upscale. And truly, I may be biased but my cookies taste amazing. Every single person that tries them are blown away. I share all my posts and updates and content to my social accounts and share them to all local groups. So I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing wrong or how I can get over this rut.\nThis is my passion. I want to continue doing this. A couple things I was thinking was, what if people are bored because they expect the same thing every week now. There\u2019s no urgency to order because they know it\u2019s always going to be there. So with that idea came maybe instead of 8 flavors (which is a lot), to focus on 6. But 4 of them will be my top sellers and stay on the menu, and the other 2 I can rotate new or old flavors out weekly. That way people have something to look forward to weekly and have anticipation but also have a few of their favorites available. I also plan to open a bakery farmstand at my home in the spring. And offer lots of other baked goods that I specialize in and have a much bigger window for people to pickup on their own time. I feel like this could help a lot.\nAnother thing I thought is, what if people are just bored of cookies. Like no one wants cookies all the time or weekly. What if they want to see something new, so I made a poll and about 100 people voted for me to do cinnamon rolls. Which I plan to do. I also realize I don\u2019t have enough clientele to where I have a good amount of people rotating orders each week. I have done plenty of giveaways and took a few samples to businesses. I plan to do that more while also making flyers and take them to local neighborhoods. I know word of mouth is everything. If people don\u2019t know me or who they are buying from, they don\u2019t trust to order. I get it.\nSo do you all have any advice? What do you see by reading this I could do differently? If you were a customer, what kind of system would you like to see if you were buying? What would make you come back for more? I will appreciate all tips! And take as much criticism as you can give me."

Instead of defrosting the berries, I just boiled them down a bit longer than directed.\nThe crust was great, the filling was amazing, but the crumble did not meet my expectations (crunchy but not enough, not enough 'crumb' in the crumb)!

He figured it out. It was fantastic. The cake came out perfect , flan texture was best I have had and the cake moist rich but not overpowering. She said it reminded her of what her grandmother had made when she was a child. And it was perfect. His version undertones of a high end chocolate cake mix.  But I could be wrong. Was devoured.

        "body": "Hi all!\nRecently I\u2019ve been experimenting with 15-minute, start-to-finish flatbreads and wanted to share what I\u2019ve learned. I\u2019m not a professional at all, just a teen who really loves baking (though I do study catering and hospitality if that makes me any more creditable!\nFor all of you that dont want to read my long ramblings of the experiments I did and how different things affect it there is a final recipe at the end of this post.\nI know that flatbread is probably pretty trivial and easy as far as bread making goes but it took me forever to master flatbread and wanted to share what I found anyway.\nFlour\nPlain flour works best when there\u2019s no real rise time. Bread flour has extra gluten, which makes the dough too elastic and harder to roll because the gluten doesn\u2019t get time to relax. Bread flour does work if that\u2019s all you have, just expect a bit more resistance when rolling.\nYeast: yes or no?\nI definitely recommend yeast. Flatbreads without yeast don\u2019t puff much and go hard and cracker-like very quickly. Yeasted flatbreads puff more and stay soft and flexible for much longer. Instant/active dried yeast is the easiest option.\nWater\nThere\u2019s no perfect amount because it depends on the flour, how dry it is, how long it\u2019s been sitting, etc. I usually add water gradually, mixing and feeling the dough as I go. As a rough guide, it\u2019s usually about 2/3 to 3/4 the volume of flour. Lukewarm water works best.\nKneading\nSince we aren\u2019t proving the dough, we don\u2019t want to knead much. Kneading develops gluten, and too much gluten makes the dough tight. That said, a little kneading is necessary to get a smooth, soft dough. About 2 to 3 minutes will do it.\nResting (very short prove)\nEven for a 15-minute flatbread, resting matters. Letting the dough sit for 5 to 10 minutes helps it relax, makes rolling easier, and massively improves puffing. No rest usually means flat, hard breads.\nI did try leaving it for a few hours once, and while it puffed slightly more and rolled thinner, the difference wasn\u2019t big enough to be worth the wait.\nRolling\nA lot of recipes say to roll the dough paper-thin, but I found that makes it harder to handle, easier to overcook, and more brittle. That works for tortilla-style breads, but if you want soft, flexible flatbreads, rolling to about pizza thickness works much better.\nCooking\nThis is the hardest part.\nThe pan needs to be very hot, but not so hot that the bread burns in seconds. I dry-fry these with no oil and always preheat the pan fully. Cooking in a cold pan stops them puffing.\nOn my induction hob (which goes to 9), 8 works best. As a general guide, use medium-high heat.\nThe bread should puff within about 30 seconds. When bubbles cover the surface, flip. The second side puffs almost immediately and only needs 10 to 20 seconds.\nThey stay soft while warm but firm up as they cool, so they\u2019re best eaten straight away (though wrapping them in foil keeps them warm for a bit).\nFinal 15-Minute Flatbread Recipe\nMakes 4 medium flatbreads, serves 2\nIngredients\n\u2022 1 cup plain flour\n\u2022 1 tsp active dried yeast\n\u2022 2/3 to 3/4 cup lukewarm water\nMethod\nMix the flour and yeast.\nAdd the water gradually until a soft dough forms.\nKnead lightly for 2 to 3 minutes until smooth.\nRest the dough for 5 to 10 minutes.\nDivide into 4 pieces and roll to pizza-like thickness.\nCook in a fully preheated, dry pan on medium-high heat until puffed and lightly spotted on both sides.\nEat warm for best results."

I\u2019ve been working on cardamom buns following the same recipe and while the flavor is always good by buns just don\u2019t seem to proof and looks like these sad flat things.. any advice?\nDough has no eggs, just milk for liquid, flour, butter and sugar and yeast. Mixed dough, rested it, rolled, shaped and proofed per the recipe. Using Fleischmanns active dry yeast. Activation phase was good, lots of bubbles and activity. The recipe says to proof at room temperature for several hours, which I did but the dough does not seem to grow at all.. not sure if room temperature is actually bad advice or my moose Saran Wrap cover is wrong, or something else?"

        "body": "Every year, I choose a cake to make for my birthday that includes techniques or ingredients I haven\u2019t used before. This time, it was black cacao powder and making caramel.\nI\u2019ve used the\nBaran Bakery Turtle Cake\nrecipe. A few notes on it - (1) I made 2 cakes and had around 600g of buttercream left over. (2) I would not follow the caramel-making technique in the recipe, just leave the sugar be without swirling it every couple of minutes, it\u2019s much more foolproof. Making it according to the recipe turned into crystallized sugar, which I saved by adding some water and a few drops of lemon juice. (3) The cake is very sweet, though the recipe insists not to reduce the sugar. However, it\u2019s a personal preference, I myself find American style buttercream too sweet.\nI really liked the deep notes of black cacao powder and coffee with a crunch of pecans. I hope colleagues and friends will enjoy it tomorrow :)"

The raspberry flavor is incredibly intense and vibrant, and I absolutely love the texture. Combined with the crunchiness of the pistachio praline, it\u2019s such a beautiful contrast. I\u2019m a huge fan of this type of praline, the caramelized crunch paired with the deep, rich pistachio flavor is just so good.\nThat said, praline-making is still a bit of a struggle for me because of my blender situation. I own a Philips ProBlend 6 3D blender, but honestly, it\u2019s not great for nut pastes. I\u2019m currently using a cheaper multi chopper that does the job. I\u2019d love to know if any of you have recommendations for a blender that does a decent job with nut pastes. Right now, this step is always a bit painful.\nI\u2019m very happy with how everything turned out. This may be my favourite recipe so far! I hope you enjoy it, let me know what you think\nRecipe and step by step process\nhere"

Here's my plan for baking a cake, please let me know if this is sane:\nThe cake(s): Carrot cake with cream cheese-based frosting. Multiple, single-tier 1/4 sheet cakes for guests, plus a small two-tier bride and groom cake (maybe 10 + 8 inch). Very simple decoration (possibly fondant carrots that make a heart shape, crushed walnuts)\nThe schedule (for a May wedding in a wedding in Montana, fairly dry weather usually):\nTuesday or Wednesday: bake layers and freeze\nThursday: ice and decorate sheet cakes and small bride and groom cake, then freeze again\nSaturday: pull cakes out of the freezer Saturday morning to thaw for serving at 5 PM."

The flavor seemed pretty good, but my loaf was rather dense/flat. Looking back, there is a comment on the recipe\u2019s webpage from someone saying that the recipe seems to be missing baking powder/soda, because they also had a dense loaf.\nHere\u2019s the recipe:\n\u00bd cup unsalted butter\n1 cup light brown sugar\n3 overripe bananas\n1 egg\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n\u00bc cup milk\n1 tsp red food coloring\n\u00bc cup cocoa powder\n1 \u00be cups all-purpose flour\nCook time: 50-60 minutes at 350f (I ended up doing about 52 minutes)\nSeems baking powder and/or baking soda is pretty much a staple in all banana bread recipes I can find (and I noticed in this creator\u2019s other banana bread recipes, she tends to use 1 or 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder). If I try this recipe again, should I try adding in that amount of baking powder? There\u2019s a few other comments on the recipe of people saying their recipes came out great, so I\u2019m not sure if part of it is user error!\nedit: formatting"

Same issue all year though, even in the summer, and this week we bought an Irish butter just out of curiosity and it softened on the counter within the hour and the land o lakes is still hard as a rock. So my question is, what's up with that? Why does that happen? Im going to switch to the Irish butter because I like buttered toast and I bake all the time and butter that actually softens makes all of that so much easier. Sorry if this isnt the right place to post this but im just confused and looking for some reason why it happens haha thanks for any help."

I did a ton of research from this group and appreciate all the info I found through here!\nRecipes below:\nSource:\nhttps://preppykitchen.com/lemon-cake/#recipe\nLemon Cake Ingredients:\n2\u00bd cups all-purpose flour\n1\u00bd teaspoons baking powder\n\u00bd teaspoon baking soda\n\u00be teaspoon salt\n1 cup unsalted butter softened\n1\u00bd cups granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons lemon zest (about 2 lemons)\n3 large eggs room temperature\n1 cup low-fat buttermilk room temperature\n\u00bc cup fresh lemon juice (about 2 lemons)\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\nInstructions For Lemon Cake:\n* Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F. Lightly grease two 9-inch round cake pans with butter or baking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper. Wrap the outside of the cake pans with soaked fabric baking strips, if you\u2019d like. (This produces flat cake layers!)\n* In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\n* In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy. Add the sugar and lemon zest and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, scrape down the bowl between additions, and beat until well combined and fluffy.\n* In a liquid measuring cup, stir the buttermilk, lemon juice, and vanilla together.\n* With the mixer on low speed, add a third of the flour mixture followed by half of the buttermilk mixture. Continue, alternating between the flour and buttermilk, mixing just until combined. Stop and scrape down the bowl occasionally. Divide the batter among the prepared cake pans.\n* Bake for 28 to 30 minutes or until the center of the cakes are springy to the touch and the sides are just starting to pull away from the pan. Let the cakes cool in the pan for 15 minutes then invert and cool completely on a wire rack.\nFROSTING\nSource:\nhttps://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7556/lemon-cream-cheese-frosting/\nLemon Frosting Ingredients:\n2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened\n\u00bd cup butter\n4 tablespoons lemon juice\n4 teaspoons lemon zest\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n10 cups confectioners' sugar, or as needed\nNote: I made double amount to have extra to decorate the cake. Also ended up only using 4 cups confectioners' sugar to give it a somewhat sugary taste but still tangy.\nInstructions For Lemon Frosting:\nBeat cream cheese, butter, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and fluffy; gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until desired consistency is reached.\nBLUEBERRY COMPOTE\nSource: Google\nFor a compote that won't run between layers, use a recipe with cornstarch and butter. The butter adds a professional, glossy finish and helps the filling set firmly.\n* Prep time: 5 mins | Cook time: 10-15 mins\n* Ingredients:\n* 4 cups fresh or frozen blueberries\n* 2/3 cup granulated sugar\n* 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice\n* 3 tbsp cornstarch (mixed with 1/4 cup water to make a slurry)\n* 2 tbsp salted butter\n* 1.5 tsp vanilla extract\n* Instructions:\n* Combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, and butter in a saucepan over medium heat.\n* Stir constantly until sugar dissolves and berries begin to break down.\n* Once simmering, slowly whisk in the cornstarch slurry.\n* Simmer for about 5 minutes until thick and \"jelly-like.\"\n* Remove from heat, stir in vanilla, and cool completely before spreading on cake."

After baking, poked all over with metal skewer to create holes for drizzle. Drizzle was made of icing sugar, juice from blood orange and lemon and Campari. Only thing I didn\u2019t follow from the recipe is that it cooked so fast I didn\u2019t get a chance to sprinkle poppy seeds and orange zest on top so after appplying the drizzle I added poppy seeds and zest and put back in the oven for 2 mins. It rested overnight and this is what I cut into.\nAny thoughts on\u00a0what would\u2019ve caused this to happen??\nRecipe from Cook House by Anna Hedworth.\nPs the cake is delicious, but oddly shaped \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"

        "body": "Hello all! I really would actually appreciate any help so much. I have been buying this milk cream bread from these two Korean French bakeries in the US-Tour Les Jour & Paris Baguette!! For years, I have been saying it\u2019s time for me to replicate and make my own. Well, now is the time. The thing is, the bread is the most pillowy soft almost steamed like bun. Clearly, it\u2019s just a tad bit underbaked. I feel like the bun part I can do. I will be using the Tangzhong method and I will be putting milk powder in the buns as well. The part that I\u2019m struggling with, is the milk cream filling to be clear, this is not a bread that has the typical whipped cream filling. It\u2019s a milk cream. I feel like it\u2019s got some type of specific texture that I haven\u2019t been able to find in other places, almost cream cheese texture, but it\u2019s not cream cheese tasting, and not exactly as firm as it either. I\u2019m confused on whether to use condensed milk, milk powder, whole milk, whipping cream, cream cheese, mascarpone. Honestly, it could be just milk, which has been heated with cornstarch to produce that texture that I\u2019m talking about. I know the taste needs milk powder. So, any tips and tricks for helping me re-create this bread perfectly it would be phenomenal, thank you so much!!!"

I\u2019m considering getting a KitchenAid stand mixer but and struggling between whether the tilt-head or bowl-lift model would be better suited for me. I\u2019ve been reading a couple of different comparisons and I feel like for the most part I\u2019m leaning towards the tilt-head but my concern is that it might not have the capacity to do heavier doughs like bagels. While I would definitely use it for cookies and cakes etc I\u2019m thinking I\u2019d use it more for breads, cinnamon buns, and bagels. I tried to use my hand mixer to make bagels and I blew the motor so the last thing I\u2019d want to do is pay all that money for a stand mixer and then blow the motor or find out I can\u2019t use it for what I\u2019m hoping for. For those of you that have the tilt-head have you had any success with heavier doughs like bagels? I\u2019m just baking for my friends/family so the bowl-lift feels a bit unnecessary but maybe I need that for the motor?"

I really only do buttercreams or cream cheese frosting for my cakes & cupcakes but my MIL always requests \"whipped cream topping\" for frosting. I did it for my SIL's bday with stabilized whipped cream (I think I used marscapone) and I hated how the decorations came out and the whipped cream still wilted significantly. She had also requested black roses which I had to make out of American buttercream to get the color and still have a stable frosting and it bled everywhere even with the white food coloring trick in both frostings.\nSo, now it's her bday and I suggested a few options and she requested her own, which of course, she wants \"whipped cream topping\" with decorations even though I did tell her on the last one I wouldn't do the whipped cream anymore especially with decorations.\nIt's important to note that she has a very very simple palette and does not eat or drink adventurously in the least - she was shocked that we at things like grilled octopus and a browned butter frosting blew her mind - so I'm not even sure that she knows what she's asking for. Asking her for further details will 100% not be helpful as I have done this in the past for many things. What I need is a recommendation for a stable frosting for decorating and icing a multi-layer cake that has the feeling of a whipped cream if that makes sense? Any suggestions (\naside from stabilized whipped cream please!\n) are appreciated!"

That's no problem, as I can add cherries, but am missing an actual cherry flavor. I have parused Amazon for some sort of cherry flavoring, but the reviews are not great for any. Any advice for a really great flavorful cherry extract/flavoring that would work great in a muffin? I don't want it to resemble cherry cough syrup, if that makes sense. Thanks in advance."

The cake is going to be a tiered cake because we have a lot of people so I get to choose a couple of different flavors and my client told me she wants one flavor that is funky and disco themed, the only thing I could think of is the confetti cake if you guys remember when we were kids that was really in, does anyone know any kind of flavor of cake that could be used as a good kind for a 70s disco themed birthday party? Oh yeah it was called funfetti I just remembered. Other than that what else could we do? Getting this professionally done, so please ideas can be as elaborate as you want it!"

I heard that swiss meringue buttercream are better than just regular buttercream, but I wanted to know if it was still easy to manipulate.\nAnd, in between layers, can I refrigerate it ? And should I let the buttercream at room temperature so it\u2019s easier ? I don\u2019t know, I'm not very experienced with buttercream , so I need advices !\nThanks for everyone who will answer :)"

And after tasting the cake, I can say that was the absolute right decision \ud83d\ude05 in fact, next time I bake it, I'll reduce the amount a bit more since I want the frosting to be a tad tangier(?).\nBut the cake is really delicious and suuuuper moist and the frosting is great too! It has such a beautiful consistency. I'm extremely happy with the result since carrot cake is among my favorites. Will definitely make it again \ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2195\ufe0f"

        "body": "Background: A couple of months ago, when I was new(er) to baking, I made a batch of banana muffins. They came out pretty good...except, a couple of days after baking, they began tasting slightly soapy.\nI was puzzled as to why the taste took so long to emerge. Looking it up online, I saw comments about them being in the molds for too long (didn't happen with me) or too much baking soda (which seemed possible, but why would that not be evident until the third day?)\nI eventually figured it might've been the recipe I followed and didn't try using it again. And my bakes didn't have that issue after that, so I put it out of my mind.\nFast forward to the present: I was meeting a friend today (Saturday) and decided to bake a banana bread (above) to gift. It came out\ngorgeous\nand I was so happy...\nOnly for disaster to strike once it had cooled down for a few hours. There was that soapy taste again! I cut narrow slivers of the bread, repeatedly and desperately experimenting to see if I could isolate the cause. At first it seemed like the taste was at the edges - had I used too much baking soda that settled down at the bottom? But it wasn't consistent.\nI was starting to wonder if banana-flavoured things and I just weren't meant to be when it finally hit me - there was a problem with the chocolate chips I used, both in this bread and to top those muffins.\nTurns out, they'd been stored in the same shelf as some soap (rookie mistake, happened a long time ago) and it wasn't until they were baked that it became evident they'd absorbed some of the soap. I didn't taste it when I checked the chips a while back, so I simply had no idea. The muffins were only topped with the chips so the taste was much less noticeable there.\nThe rest of the bread was still delicious, but of course I couldn't gift my friend that.\nI was scrambling to come up with something else to bake (it was past 10pm on Friday) and managed some chocolate muffins instead. Thankfully they came out pretty good, and I was able to hand them over today.\nAnyway. All's well that ends well. I will now proceed to demolish the banana bread (after picking out the chocolate chips, of course.) And I now know that the banana bread and banana muffin recipes I followed were perfectly fine, actually.\nJust putting this out there as a warning to fellow baking noobs. Sometimes the most unexpected things can trip you up. The chocolate chips were well-sealed; never in a million years would I have imagined they'd absorb enough soap from the air to be able to effect something like this."

I tried piping the leaves and flowers seperately onto a tray then freezing and adhering to the cupcake after they'd frozen, but they started melting practically as soon as they were taken out of the freezer.\nI know cream cheese is naturally a bit more like this compared to other frostings, but is there anything that could make it a bit better, apart from adding more icing sugar? Thanks :)"

This will probably use around 8 gallons for these three, but we're stumped on what else we could make.\nEdit:\nSome people mentioned freezing the milk, but unfortunately that is not an option for us. Others have mentioned taking the milk to all kinds of shelters, food banks, and even other facilities. The latter we likely won't get permission for, as the closest facility (owned by the same company) is about an hour away, and it's unlikely that anyone would be willing to make the trip (we also need permission from the administrator and possibly hr). As for the former, while I would like to go this route and donate the milk, as previously stated, we would need permission, and I think it's highly unlikely that they would allow it, based off of previous experiences.\nThank you all for the suggestions!

For the obvious copyright reasons I can't exactly post the specific recipe, but I was hoping that maybe either someone who knows it or one similar enough could help me.

I think I spent like 5 hours just on making tons of buttercream and getting it the perfect colour (I have loads leftover which I will be using to make cupcakes). I did not realise the crumb coat and top (?) coat would be such a nightmare, I probably spent an hour and a half on just that. I wanted the border to look more leafy but it's good the way it is too! Would love some (kind) constructive criticism. I tried the trick of whipping my butter for the buttercream for 15 minutes but unfortunately my stand mixer did not want to mix it properly and it kept gumming up the whisk attachment and sticking to the sides, so the buttercream had a few air bubbles.\nI used Sally's Baking Addiction's 6 inch chocolate cake recipe and doubled it to have two layers. Buttercream was just 1:1 butter and icing sugar."

Doesn\u2019t taste it at all and it doesn\u2019t get caught in your teeth but I had someone I know who continuously would say my cookies are under when they look like this and it threw me off.. but everyone else is apparently obsessed so I\u2019m confused haha\nWhat do you guys think?"

I then let cool 10 minutes on wire rack in the pan, then removed to foil on my marble counter. These are a lot larger than I usually make, they are beautiful and I think letting that dough rest allows the sugar to fully incorporate into the dough, which gives you a beautiful Sheen on the cookies, after they\u2019re baked at least I think it\u2019s related to the sugar.

Not everyone does though.\nBraid it, loaf it, bun it, shape it as you would like. After all, you are the Dunn\u2019s of your brioche buns.\nBrush with an egg wash. Then bake it for 25 minutes at 375F, covering it after 20 minutes with foil if it is browning too much.\nNotes:\nBrioche is low on hydration (10-30%), very high on eggs (40%) and butter (40%) and just enough sugar (10%) for a hint of sweetness.\nKeep everything except the butter cold. The butter needs to be cool, NOT cold NOR warm; it has to be able to incorporate into the dough, but if it is too warm it will give a greasy dough."

I want to perfect it before, so I'm going to bake it tomorrow. it is my first time baking this particular pie(I'm usually more biscuits, strudel, yeast-based recipes type of person) and second time baking a pie with stuff inside of it(and the first time was a catastrophe, though I insist that it was the quinces' fault), so I've got a bunch of questions:\n1)\nThe blind baking\nMy first time doing it-I found some informations about it, but there are so many opinions. Should I use paper parchment or aluminium foil?  And about the stuff inside-I don't really want to use beans since they would be unusable then, and I don't have any of the special ceramic weights-I came across suggestion to use sugar as the weight, and the article claimed I could then use it. Do you have any experience? Also, if I baked the sugar, can I then(after it cools) use it for the meringue? There is also a discord as to whether to remove the parchment/foil for a few minutes to brown the crust-I prefer crunchier, but I don't want it to be rock hard. The recipe says to bake for 15 minutes at 180 Celsius and then for 20 or 25 minutes with the baking paper removed.\n2)\nThe starch for the filling\nMy recipe says potato starch, but I also have seen cornstarch(but I don't have that one), and I considered using vanilla pudding. Can the potato starch influence the flavour negatively?\n3)\nMeringue\nThis one also worries me-the recipe says to use caster sugar(I think that is the English translation, the most basic of sugars)-so again, can I use the one from blind baking, or will it taste weird? And I don't have those fancy piping bags-can I just scoop it on the pie(with the cooled filling on top) and spread it out with a knife or spatula?\nSorry for the long post, and I'm sorry if my English isn't comprehensive(I don't know the English baking vocabulary).\nRecipe I go from is\nhere\n-it is in Czech, so you would have to use google translate or ask me, I'll try to translate it the best I can."

Cupcakes, cookies, cupcakes and more cookies pretty much! :) and also, back then, a lot of us, my age and younger we ate the cookie dough that was prepared even though it could have caused us to be sick because the egg I believe was still raw..\nSo in my 20s, I became aware of the instant cookie dough that you can just take right off of an refrigerated piece of paper. I suppose, and then you just put it on the... cookie sheet ...baking pan...? \n:( \nSee?, I don't even know what to say. It's terrible. I feel like I'm glad we're not in the same room because I'd be blushing.\nSo i just stick it in the oven? Which I know is heresy? It's like, anyone here who likes to bake from scratch is probably cursing me out or saying tisk tisk? Well, sorry. I really need just a bit of guidance.\n I just bought the pre-made cookie dough and just asking for a bit of help for the baker who may come back. Can you please tell me what kind of pan I may need? A baking sheet right? If there's one in particular, because then I'll go buy it. And then I remember there may be something you spray on it?. I know because you don't want it to stick... So you guys can really hear that I have no vivid memories. \n Cupcakes, you have a cupcake tin, and you put in little paper things or the cookies I knew how to make, especially with different shapes and sizes because I had a little cutouts, and I already knew how. So guys, just consider me a complete novice. And any contribution would be greatly appreciated, because-- just think --this could be me tipping my toe back into the world.\n. I do want to take the plunge and try to bake. It would be kind of cool if it came out even a bit well. And this is, I know a bit of heresy because it's not homemade... its prepared dough. But if you could just give me the basics and something that I could even just look up in terms of pan and stuff like that.Thank you.\nAnd also this is my first time posting in your group.

        "body": "(Recipe provided at the bottom of the body text)\nI recently put this recipe together and refined it based on everything that I want from a brownie (moist, chewy, dense, rich and somewhat complex chocolate flavor, and not overly sweet).\nI\u2019m not necessarily a stranger to baking, but I am typically more of a recipe follower, whereas this is one of the few times I have created a recipe and tweaked it to meet my expectations. So with that said, I apologize if the recipe itself has somewhat of an unusual format compared to what more experienced bakers on this sub might be used to; the recipe was intended for personal use so I formatted it in a way that made sense to me intuitively, but after having a lot of friends and family really enjoy the brownies and ask for the recipe, I thought it would be nice to share it here on the chance that others would be interested in brownies like this and/or a recipe for them that could be adapted to personal tastes.\nThe resulting brownies come out with the aforementioned targeted qualities, retain their moisture really well, and have a rich and complex chocolatey taste that is only subtly sweet compared to the almost excessive sweetness (in my opinion) of many other recipes or box mixes that I have tried in the past. While the top face/crust is a bit tougher than the rest of the brownie, it still ends up pretty soft and chewy after the brownies have been cut and placed in a sealed container to give the trapped moisture a chance to disperse more evenly.\nIf anyone has any questions about the recipe/process/ingredient choices, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will do my best to answer everything, just don\u2019t be too harsh since, as stated prior, I am far from an expert and only create recipes like this very infrequently lol. Furthermore, if anyone here decides to make them then please let me know how they turned out and how you liked them; I\u2019d love to hear what others have to say, good or bad, so long as any criticism is kept respectful.\nAnyways, I\u2019m not trying to write out my life story here or anything, so without further ado you will find the recipe provided below.\nSemi sweet brownies - moist, dense, and chewy.\nBaking dish: 8x8 inch Pyrex baking dish, parchment lined\nOven: 350\u00b0F\nPrep time: 10-15 minutes\nBake time: ~28 minutes\nWet ingredients:\n\u2022 6 tbsp salted butter, melted (I recommend Land O Lakes)\n\n\u2022 3 Tbsp olive oil (I recommend Terra Delyssa or similar)\n\n\u2022 2 large eggs\n\n\u2022 \u00be tsp vanilla extract\n\n\u2022 2 & 1/2 Tbsp milk\n\n\u2022 1 & 1/2 Tbsp strong dark coffee (I recommend Death Wish brewed bold)\nDry ingredients:\n\u2022 \u00bd cup granulated sugar\n\n\u2022 \u00bd cup light brown sugar, packed\n\n\u2022 \u00be cup unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-process (I recommend Ghirardelli Dutch-process)\n\n\u2022 \u2154 cup all-purpose flour\n\n\u2022 5/8 tsp cornstarch\n\n\u2022 3/8 tsp granulated salt\n\n\u2022 1/8 tsp baking powder\nNote: if using unsalted butter, adjust granulated salt to 5/8 tsp\nInstructions:\n1.    Prep: Heat oven to 350\u00b0F and line an 8x8 inch Pyrex baking dish with parchment paper.\n\n2.    Dry Mix: Add all of the dry ingredients into a bowl (excluding brown sugar) and whisk until no visible clumps remain, then add the brown sugar and whisk again.\n\n3.    Wet Mix: Add all of the wet ingredients into a different bowl (excluding eggs) and mix with a whisk or fork. Ensure the mix is room temperature to warm but not hot before adding in the eggs and mixing again.\n\n4.    Combine: Pour the wet mix into the dry mix then use a rubber scraper to ensure minimal liquid is left behind in the wet mix bowl, then whisk together until the batter reaches a smooth and thick consistency with no noticeable clumps.\nBake: Transfer the batter into the lined Pyrex dish using a scraper to ensure minimal loss, level the batter into the dish by tilting and surface smoothing with the scraper, then bake for 28 minutes.\nTest: Check the brownies at the 28 minute mark using a toothpick test in the center, then check near each corner ~1.5 inches in from the sides of the dish. If they are done baking, the toothpick will come out clean from all spots, otherwise bake for 2 more minutes and check again until it does.\nCool: Let the brownies cool until they reach room temperature (typically 2 - 2.5 hours), then put the lid on the dish or cover it with foil and refrigerate for 45 minutes.\nPortion: Pull the brownies out of the dish using the parchment, lay them top side down on a cutting board to peel away the parchment, then cut the brownies into the desired size and place them in sealed Tupperware for storage (ensures the brownies don\u2019t dry out).\nSoften: Let brownies come up to room temperature in Tupperware before eating. If the top is still slightly hard afterwards then let them sit for another 1-2 hours in the sealed Tupperware to allow the trapped moisture to disperse more evenly.\nNote: The brownies pair nicely with coffee, unsweetened tea, and milk (though they work well with pretty much any beverage of choice that\u2019s not overly sweet)"

I was going to try coconut flour or powdered milk as back up if I couldn't find the flour and as I was talking my partner through the shopping list he conceded that we could use a bit of icing sugar since the cake itself had no sugar in it (just date paste for sweetness). Used 500g cream cheese, 250g butter and about 170g icing sugar and it turned out fantastic!"

        "body": "I purchased a bag of tartaric acid because I love that zingy sour flavor thats found in a lot of treats like sour patch kids, blue raspberry flavorings, sweet tarts etc. I've even tried using it in plain carbonated water with a spritz of lemon & lime juice along with a dash of coconut extract & was surprised at how 'tropically tasty' & refreshing it is.\nMy original intent was to try & replicate that yummy blue raspberry flavor that's found in those classic 'blue treats' that I loved as a kid (ok, still love as an adult), but in cookie form.\nToday, I'm just starting out my 'experimentation stage' & upon doing further research I read that tartaric acid reactes to baking soda to make it rise more & that the soda neutralizes the sour taste unless you add a ratio of more acid than base to the mixture. I also use double acting baking powder which also contains sodium bicarbonate which would most likely neutralize the sour flavor even further.\nI'm also using stevia instead of sugar (I try to stay away from sugar in my diet due to health concerns). I also read that tartaric acid is sometimes used in stevia as a 'flavor correcter' giving it the perception of 'enhanced sweetness'.\nAgain, I'm looking for that sour patch taste so equal amounts of sour & sweet sound fine, but only if the other ingredients wouldn't weaken the flavor profile I'm looking for.\nIt appears that this phenomenon also applies to a recipe I found for 'sour patch kid cookies' where the candies are added to the cookie dough before baking, but it from what others have said, the sour taste from the candy also weakens after baking.\nWith all of that I was hoping for some advice as to the best way to use tartaric acid when trying to get that strong sweet tart taste I'm looking for in a cookie. I'm not sure if adding more tartaric acid to the cookie dough would do the trick (or how much to add) or if just sprinkling some on the tops of already baked cookies right out of the oven would be better. Any advice I can get would be very appreciated \ud83d\ude00"

I used browned butter instead of regular butter, reduced the sugar immensely, and used chocolate bars instead of chips, also chill overnight. I also make my own butter, if you can, I absolutely recommended it! Use a cream that is 36% or higher if you can find it.\n188g all-purpose flour\n1 heaping teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n226g browned butter, softened. Don\u2019t skimp on the browned butter\u2026game changer!\n1 very scant cup (180-ish grams) brown sugar\n2 large eggs, at room temperature\n1 Tablespoon molasses\n2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract\n255g old-fashioned whole rolled oats\n315g chopped chocolate bars (I used 2 Lindt 70% bars and 1 Lindt milk chocolate bar)\n- Mix flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt.\n- Cream butter and sugar for a few minutes, then add eggs, molasses and vanilla.\n- Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until combined.\n- Add in oats and chocolate\n- Leave in the fridge overnight if you can! Or the day\u2026but omg it makes a huge difference.\n- Preheat oven to 350F, and scoop dough into 2-ish tablespoon balls and bake for 13-ish minutes. Mine took exactly 13 minutes but will depend on the oven. They will be soft in the middle still and brown on the outsides.\n- Sprinkle with some kosher salt\n- Let cool and dig in!"

        "body": "Hi everyone. I\u2019m not new to baking, but I am new to baking cakes. I\u2019m making a cake for the Super Bowl, and decided to be really ambitious. The plan is for a three-tier lemon Victoria sandwich with blueberry compote between layers, then iced in ABC. It\u2019s a lot to do right but I felt comfortable with every individual step. A butter cake felt best because it\u2019d be easy to work with for decoration, as a newbie at cakes.\nFor each layer, I\u2019m using 150g of each ingredient in an 8-inch cake tin. Butter/sugar creamed, then (3) eggs, lemon zest, then folding in self-raising flour (since my recipe called for it - I\u2019d like to stick with it rather than try something wholly new). Then straight in the oven at 350 F until cooked (25-30 mins). My first practice, the taste was great but it didn\u2019t rise much at all and ended up about 1\u201d in thickness, and as a result felt a bit stodgy. I was hoping for 1.25 to 1.5 and fluffier, especially since I\u2019ll slice the domes.\nI did some research and decided to be more careful with my technique the second time. I made sure to beat the butter plenty and not overwork the flour, but it came out the same. On the third go, I diverted 50g of sugar into the eggs and brought them all the way to ribbon stage to try to get more air into it that way. But it didn\u2019t change anything. It\u2019s not collapsing from what I can tell. It\u2019s just not rising. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my technique - there\u2019s something off somewhere else.\nWhat are my options? I only have one more practice bake left, and so probably only one more variable to change. Is that sort of height (1\u201dish before the dome) typical for an 8\u201d tin and my ingredient load? Is the solution adding a touch of extra baking powder? If so, how much - 1/2tsp? Increasing the total batter size additionally? Splitting the whites and yolks and doing a full sort of hybrid sponge?\nThanks! I went through every previous post I could on Victorias."

Of course, I jumped into action to bake a little 6\u201d, 2-layer vanilla cake, covered it in chocolate frosting, and gave him a piping bag and sprinkles to do whatever he wanted. Took a bit of encouragement and a plethora of damp paper towels on deck to wipe messy hands, but he made it happen!\nNow excuse me while I happy sob into a piece of preschooler-germ-infested cake as he did also sneeze directly onto it \ud83e\udd72"

I use well and good flour (Tapioca Starch, Rice Flour, Potato Starch, Dextrose Monohydrate, Thickeners (Xanthan Gum), and Vegetable Emulsifier).\nI have a vanilla cake recipe i like and follow by gluten free alchemist, and i was wondering if there was a way to alter the recipe to be caramel? So far my thoughts are changing 80% of the sugar to brown sugar, but worried about the density of the cake and whether or not that would actually do anything. Another idea is using caramel essence in place on vanilla extract?\nIve tried following gluten recipes and subbing with Bobs red mill 1:1, but not keen on continuing to do that as it\u2019s over 3x the price. I\u2019ve also been mud cake recipes which call for white chocolate, but once again in this economy not keen.\nSorry for the really long message, I hope that all makes sense and hope everyone has lovely days!"

I've been making no-bake peach pies by making shortbread, ginger snap or coconut flour crusts and filling with the uncooked but freezer mushy fruit and the crushed fruit thickened with cornstarch and sweetened. But I'm looking to expand. I'm bringing a dessert to a large potluck on Friday and I was thinking of something easier to serve than a very messy pie.\nOne idea is more like a tart, with a thicker caky layer under a 'thinner than pie' layer of the same mixture. The choices are either a sweet shortcake or a more savory buttermilk biscuit that would offset the sweet fruit filling.\nMy sister, an excellent cook, had an idea to do a trifle, with layers of pound cake, peach stuff and custard. Another was to serve it like a DIY shortcake, a plate of cut biscuit or shortcake and a bowl of peaches and goo to spoon over it, with whipped cream available. But my wife thought that might confuse people serving themselves.\nSo there it is. Any other great ideas? Excess fruit is a luxury burden I know! Crazily enough we live in the city. We give away a lot, and make a lot of peach and kiwi leather. (80 lbs of kiwi berries this year!)\nEDIT: I made a 9x13 pan of buttermilk biscuit and topped it with a single layer of peach slices and the 'peach pudding'. We'll see how the crowd likes it tonight."

Here's the kicker: they have to be able to be transported 2.5-3hrs in the car without much option for refrigeration (tough, I know).\nI play Dungeons and Dragons (a tabletop roleplay game) with a group of friends every couple of weeks and like to bring some baked goods for everyone to share as snacks, but I find I fall back on a lot of sweet bakes as that is most of what I know how to do. However, I definitely prefer savoury things and I think both myself and my friends are getting a little tired of the uber-sweet spreads I put on almost every session. I live about a 2.5hr drive from where we play, so I am always worried about making things that require keeping cool. I do have access to a cooler and ice packs, but even then I always feel a little weird about it; I don't want to make my friends OR myself sick!\nIf anyone has any suggestions, I would be more than happy to take them on board any try something new! As I said, this is an ongoing thing that happens every couple of weeks, so I am always looking for new things to try!\nThank you so much in advance <3"

She made this bread her whole life, and it was what I and my siblings ate (not STORE-BOUGHT bread, heavens). An older sister finally had Mom make the bread, and watched her and took notes, in about 1980. I have added further explanation and amendments in brackets\n4 cups warm water\n[warm but not hot to the touch so you don't kill the yeast]\n2 pkgs yeast\n(1Tbsp + 1tsp)\n1/2 cup\n[granulated]\nsugar\n[I usually use 1/4 cup]\nLet sit for a few minutes. [It should become foamy.]\nStir in\nenough\n[all-purpose]\nflour\nto make a soft batter. [It's\nabout 4 cups\n. Beat it well, I use a wooden spoon.]\nAdd:\n1/2 c melted shortening\n[or vegetable oil]\n1 Tbsp\n[table]\nsalt\nenough more flour\nto make a soft dough [\nabout 4 more cups\n]\n[Beat it well. The gluten will be starting to make it very sticky and harder to stir at all.]\n[When the flour is all moistened, turn out the dough onto a very well floured surface.] Knead until smooth [adding more flour as you go to keep it from sticking]. [Put back into now-greased bowl, 'rounding up' in the bowl to oil the outside of the dough. Cover with plastic wrap and towel over that. Set into a warm spot.] Let rise once [until doubled, about 1 hour depending on kitchen temperature.]\nPut on pans. [By this she means: Tip out onto floured counter, divide into three pieces. You can use a kitchen scale to ensure they're about the same size. For each piece, carefully flatten to press out any extra air bubbles then roll up into a fat cylinder, tuck the ends under, and place into a greased loaf pan.] Let rise again. [about another hour, until the loaves are risen just about an inch above the edge of the loaf pan.]\nBake at 375 until light brown [about 40-45 minutes. You can tap it lightly, if it sounds hollow it's done. Turn out of pans onto a wire rack to cool. When they are completely cool, bag the loaves. They freeze really well.]\n[I have successfully swapped out up to half the flour for wheat flour and/or bread flour. I burned out my KitchenAid on ciabatta a few years ago, so I do all the stirring and kneading by hand.]"

I baked them at 375F for 16 minutes and checked on them, I could tell they weren\u2019t done but the tops were getting golden, so I tented with foil (as per instructions if this happened).  I also stuck a bluetooth thermometer in the center to monitor the temp.  Instructions said they are done between 190-200F.\nInstructions said bake time would be between 24-27 minutes to bake, but it took closer to 40 before they were done.   Even with foil on them, they got very brown and crunchy on top.  They\u2019re still very tasty, but how do I prevent that from happening next time?\nI used center rack in oven.\nBrand new oven plus hanging thermometer to confirm temp.\nBaked in round metal cake tin.\nRecipe:\nhttps://sallysbakingaddiction.com/easy-cinnamon-rolls-from-scratch/#tasty-recipes-66508"

Followed everything to a T.\nhttps://youtu.be/JvrLdmDbMXU?si=DJ1pHcHZ6ChkDVEA\nOnly difference was I mixed sweetened dried blueberries in the dough. Nonetheless, mine came out flat and pale. I wanted to understand why. I don't just want to follow times, I want to understand what exactly I should be seeing from the dough at each phase. For example, the video states to knead in the mixer for 5 minutes. But instead of just relying on time, how do I know when the dough has been kneaded enough? Window pane test, poke test? What exactly am I looking for to know it's ready for the next step. Then she stated to rest it for 1-1/2 hours. Well from my understanding this can result in different doughs depending on kitchen temp, etc. So again, what do I want to look for to know it's ready for the next step of cutting the pieces. Then she states to rest for 15 minutes, again, what do I want to actually see from the dough. Then after shaping, is 15 minutes really enough to sit before they go in the  fridge? Really trying to understand what I should see each step so I can get this right and understand the actual science instead of just relying on time. Thank you in advance.\nI'm very new to doughs. I've done pizza, donuts, and soft pretzels all with no issues. Bagels are giving me a hard time though \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"

I have found larger toaster ovens to be just as good or even better for smaller dishes like, potatoes, tarts, pies, brownies than ovens. It's less electric, gets to desired temp fast, easy to open and maneuver and isn't heating up the kitchen. My issue is, all the over I have owned start falling apart after 3-4 years. So every few years or so I replace it. Meanwhile my oven, that's 15 years old works just as good as the day I got it. At this point I have spent more money on the toaster ovens then my oven. Here's my question. Are there any good toaster ovens that last? I have been using the Hamilton Beach (31103DA) for the last 8 years, switching it out every 3ish. The paint numbers near the knobs is all rubbing off. The knobs themselves are melting and warping popping off. The convection motor sounds like a lawn mower."
