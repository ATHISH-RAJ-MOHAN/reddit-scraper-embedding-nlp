        "body": "I love how they have such a low carbon footprint compared to meat and how they barely need any resources to be grown, as well as improving soil conditions.\nI love to go to the store and look at the price tag of a big bag of dried beans that I'm about to buy (costs almost nothing).\nI love the huge variety of shapes, sizes and color that beans come in (much like human beings) and how pretty they look when many sorts of beans are mixed together colorfully in a dish.\nI love how they have such different flavors. I love the nuttiness of chickpeas, the slight sweetness of black beans, the smokiness of kidney beans, the mild flavor of white beans, the slightly peppery taste of lentils. It's like they all have different personalities.\nI love running my hand through a big bowl of dried beans, like little marbles of goodness, before soaking them overnight. I would totally jump into a bathtub full of dried beans if it wouldn't mean food waste.\nI love the soft, almost creamy texture the beans get when you boil them with salt and baking soda.\nI love their taste and how they can be added into pretty much any kind of dish. They are just so versatile.\nI love thinking about ways to incorporate beans into the next meal I cook.\nAnd perhaps most importantly, I love how rich they are in protein, fiber, resistant starch and other nutrients while also having pretty much no drawbacks for the health if cooked properly. They just make me feel so good.\nI have been a vegetarian since I was ten years old. I have not touched meat for almost thirteen years and I have rarely had any meat cravings. However, I have cravings for beans every day. I also eat them every day for pretty much every major meal, except for when I have oat porridge for breakfast. I always think about different ways to cook beans and fantasize about eating them. Saying I love beans would not be enough, let's just say I fucking love beans.\nI'm curious to hear how other people feel about beans.",
        "top_comment": "If you're not familiar with Rancho Gordo, you should check them out. THey regularly get great varietals from all over Mexico and Central America that I haven't found anywhere else, as well as their own varieties of your favorites. I also love beans and 100% agree with everything you've said here. Its a lot of what you like about meat (and who doesn't like meat?) plus fiber and such. An incredibly versatile, delicious, and efficient crop."

        "body": "I don't really like my cooking, guests and relatives don't agree..\nI tend to become very ambitious. Meatballs? Spice it up with some dijon, herbs (oregano, or some thyme), some spices (allspice, white pepper, maybe some red pepper), some ginger powder, maybe even some juniper or star anis depending on the season? I add a little, fry up a small piece to taste and I may find the flavors a bit dull, so I add a bit more until I feel like there's a good balance. Then I cook the batch, and in the end I feel like it's way too noisy, no natural meat flavor shines through and I end up disappointed. I tried to use less stuff next time and the meatballs were either bland or lacked something. I can even use the exact same recipe my dad uses, and they're not remotely as good..\nI've noticed this weird phenomenon where the same recipe cooked by someone else tastes better because you lack the same insight or whatever, but that can't be all?\nThe first issue with the meatball example is to interprete a taste test. Like with sauces, tasting a teaspoon worth and finding it \"bland\" only to spice it up, which makes a tablespoon worth way too overpowering. But I can't eat and entire portion as a \"taste test\". Larger volumes of a food will \"increase\" the flavours, but if I try to offset by adding less stuff I'm still not satisfied with the end result.\nI also tend to make everything taste about the same. I think I always strive for balance, so if something is decent but lacks acidy I'll add something, too bright I'll add some more musty flavours, too sour I'll add some fats or something. But I just end up with the same very \"flavourful\" taste where nothing really sticks out. If I try to correct this and let some part be \"lacking\" it just ends up being too unbalanced.\nThe latest disappointment was a pork \"stew\" with 2lbs pork, 2 onions, 1 clove garlic, 2 cups fresh mushrooms and 2 cups cream. Served with potatoes. I fried everything to perfection, added some salt and pepper to the meat, salt and vinegar to the mushrooms (which also deglazed the pan), and just salt to the onions. Everything was great individually. Put it in a pot, add the cream, some soy sauce, boulion, dijon and tomato paste. Recipe called for 4 teaspons of dijon which I reduced to 1.5 teaspon. Everything then tasted like dijon anyway. Combat with some paprika powder. Let it simmer for 10 minutes. It is now incredibly noisy and boring. Nothing sticks out, the dijon is still too prevalent and it just tastes \"strong\", lots of umami, but it's so boring. Fearing that I'll ruin it more with spices or herbs I just portioned it up and gave a sigh as I'll have another week of uninteresting food ahead of me. Just like every time I try to make a pot-like dish like this.",
        "top_comment": "Less is more.  You fell into the same trap many cooks do.  I fell into this about a decade ago.  Everything tasted similar.\nPick a profile of flavor and stick to that profile.  If you are doing something Italian, there should be no soy sauce what so ever in it.  If you need salt, use salt, anchovies, olives, or capers.  If you are cooking east asian food, soy it up, fish sauce, shrimp paste, no creams, no cheese, no paprika, etc.  Don't cross profiles.  Crossing profiles makes difference cuisines taste similar.\nIf you put soy in something, cream should not be part of it and vice versa.  East Asian dishes do not utilize dairy and the ingredients need to reflect that.\nYou are trying to hit all the flavors at once, stop.  Pick a single flavor.  Make a dish with oregano, and no other herbs.  Garlic, onion fine, but no ginger.  Ginger isn't a flavor paired with Oregano.  Just Oregano.  Steam some clams, melt some butter with oregano in to, pour it over the steamed clams, throw them in the broiler for a little color, then pour all that over some linguine or with a crusty bread.\nThis right here, \"soy sauce, boulion, dijon and tomato paste\" you have all powerful flavors competing, its too much.  No soy for that, Worstershire would have been more aligned as soy and tomato are typically never in the same cuisine, ever.  Dijon?  no, just a tsp of mustard powder to enhance, not to dominate.  Dijon you want to taste when its appropriate to taste dijon, like in a ham sandwich or with corned beef, not in a cream sauce."

They don\u2019t spoil due to being dry.\nWe used to make an oat flour like substance by grinding this up in a coffee grinder.\nNowadays though with gluten free options being more necessary commercial oat flour is offered.\nThis is finer, better ground, and much more consistent. It is also completely uncooked. It has the same dangers that raw flour can have.\nThis is a very very small chance of salmonella or ecoli.\nYou can sanitize your out flour by heating it in an oven at a temp for a certain amount of time, look it up somewhere online.\nI would probably make a batch of these without doing that though. The danger is slight. Or just use rolled oats ground up."

So I have to carry what I make on public trans and cannot reheat.\nI've decided on chicken pot pie with a cheddar biscuit situation on top. And by chicken pot pie I mean slow roasting a whole chicken slathered with butter, garlic and herbs, deboning it and making my own chicken stock, browning bacon, saut\u00e9ing onion, garlic, celery, carrots, and leeks in bacon fat, adding in some shiitake mushrooms, deglazing with a nice Italian white wine, adding my homemade stock and throwing the bacon back in, still deciding if I'm gonna add cream or not, then topping with homemade cheddar thyme biscuits. I feel like this fits the theme of indulgent and comforting.\nWhile the rice crispy treats were a popular idea, this is for a cookbook club so I do want to contribute a more intricate dish. Plus adding variety to all the desserts others are already making.\nLastly, to the few who have shared negative thoughts... Idk man. Practice reading things with neutrality?

It is the carbon dioxide that causes the bread to rise.\nIt best works at around 40  to 45 deg c for maximum growth.\nHow ever it is the lactic acid bacteria (LAB, ie, lactobacillus) that develops the flavours in sour dough bread.\nThese bacteria take longer to produce the lactic acid giving the bread flavour so the fermentation needs to be slowed down hence lower temperatures are required to slow down fermentation give the LAB more time to develop lactic acid. The longer at low temperatures the stronger the flavours."

        "body": "Really good prices on these meat trimmings in Aldi, but they are large packs at 500g. The meat looks good and it's nice to make a quick sandwich.\nPackaging says :\nUse within 24 hours of opening.\nNot suitable for home freezing.\nNow I would like to freeze half this pack as there's no way it will be eaten in 24 hours. Is this even half sensible given the packaging guidelines. What is the reason the timings are so tight on these meat packs.\nMany thanks",
        "top_comment": "You basically have to cook it immediately. After, you can freeze it.\nMake sure to cook it well!\nSo... Use it for shoarma meat or something similar.\nThe 'no home freezing' means it's been out long enough, exposed long enough, to grow cultures. If you freeze it from raw, you're just going to preserve those, and even at low temperatures, some reproduction might still happen. So you need to cook  it."

Anyone have tips on velveting chicken without it having so much of the taste of baking soda?",
        "top_comment": "The idea that velveting involves baking soda has spread through the internet in recent years when it\u2019s just not the case. Baking soda can be used, but it\u2019s cornstarch (or potato starch) plus rice wine that are the constants, with egg white as an alkaline tenderizer being more typical than baking soda. Passing through the oil is also important in the process. \nIt\u2019s likely what you\u2019re tasting in restaurants has no baking soda.\nHaving said that, I find 1/4-1/2 tsp is enough for 1 lb of meat, and I see a lot of recipes calling for 1 tsp.\nI am sensitive to baking soda, but I find no taste of it provided you don\u2019t skip the wine in the marinade.\nYou also do not need it at all for chicken. Velvet chicken gets egg white, not baking soda."

It's one teaspoon and the flavor you will lose is absolutely minimal. It's more for counteracting the gaminess of the meat anyway. Trust me, there will be almost no noticeable difference omitting a teaspoon of wine in such a salted, funky, and heavily-flavored sauce as laoganma. Adding tea, balsamic, vinegar, whatever else is going to significantly change the flavor way more than omitting.

I did a test run a week ago on the mousse and the main dish, went perfectly.\nDuring the whole week I kept thinking \"the test run went a bit too well, feels like something's gonna happen during the actual run\". How prophetic that was.\nI was whipping cream (by hand) in a big bowl with a big whip, both the bowl and the whip were bigger than during the test run. I was also whipping very little cream with respect to how big the bowl and whip were. I incorporated so much air so quickly that I didn't even notice the peaks forming. I thought I was still at the early stages of the mixing when suddenly, just like a sponge, my mixture spits out a big quantity of liquid, and I'm left with a doughey ball. And for the first time, totally by accident, I had made butter by hand. Thankfully, I still had cream, so I repeated the process with a smaller whip and a smaller bowl and got my whipped cream.\nMy second mistake, *much* more fatal. I used the whip I whipped the cream with to whip egg whites. I had been whipping like a madman for well over 20 minutes and the mixture was still very liquid. I thought something was wrong, and I remembered that a tiny sliver of egg yolk had slipped when I separated the whites. I remembered that in one of the tutorials I had watched, chef Jean Pierre said to not have yolks in the whites (I ended up not using his recipe). After some research, turns out you can't have fat when whipling your egg whites. I think the butter on the whip was a much bigger problem than the tiny drop of yolk. My recipe calls for 3 eggs, and I only had 2, so I had to rush to buy a crate of eggs. In my daily life, I try to be as vegan as possible, and I usually only consume eggs that come from our farm so I can guarantee freshness/ethical treatment of the animal, so it was a bit of a bummer. In any case, I think it all worked out in the end. My glasses of mousse are resting in the fridge, and according to what I tasted from the spatula, I think the mousse is gonna be pretty good.\nI was ruminating while rewhipping the egg whites, but then a quick sniff at the chocolate made me relax and reminded me why I was doing it. So yeah, we learn everyday !",

I have to cook about enough for a few days and the container can\u2019t be huge because I\u2019m working with virtually half a shelf of fridge space. I need to use everything I\u2019m cooking with for each singular time, save for spices and whatnot, but all ingredients have to be exactly enough for the amount I\u2019m cooking and the rest is thrown out because it\u2019ll use up too much space. And it has to reheat well for future meals.\nI cook every Monday and Thursday night and eat out 2x a week after church and after work w a coworker, and it\u2019s the same stuff but I need new ideas. Here\u2019s my list:\n- Small batch of enchiladas (6) (Sam\u2019s club)\n- Taco salad\n- Spaghetti bolognese\n- Tacos on flour tortillas\n- Batch of stuffed bell peppers (4)\n- Chili\nNeed more, help!!! I\u2019m open to frozen stuff as long as it\u2019s not super spacious. And canned or pre-made stuff.",

Replace it every 2 to 3 months if it's really bad.\nYou can remove any odors by baking the ice cube trays. Bake them at 250-350\u00b0 for 30-60 minutes.

I'm not too experienced in making sauces from scratch, otherwise I'd probably just start experimenting with it.\nI'm confident I have every other ingredient I'd need.

I use it for regular roti atta as well as seasonal stuff like methi atta, palak atta etc.\n- I say piece of shit, because this is a very poor quality plastic construction and the motor gyrates the frame slightly when kneading dough, over time resulting in the base of the machine cracking and then it'd start to grind/burn the plastic parts in the jar. We've had to buy a new jar cause of this. Sadly, all the models I've found in croma or online have all been plastic construction and as the dough will clump up, it'll make the whole machine gyrate and you'd have to use both hands to keep the jar steady..ugh\nI'd highly recommend getting a dough hook instead.\nSomething like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.in/Durability-Accessories-Dishwasher-Kneading-Kratos-Plus/dp/B0CX4T932R\nEasier to clean as well.

Instead the chicken is marinated in a mix of soy, sugar, spices and rice wine for at least an hour.\nSame cooking principle as velveting, when you expose proteins to salt or alkaline solutions, the protein molecules unwind and loosen up at the molecular level. The opposite is acid, which makes proteins curdle and tighten up."

        "top_comment": "no, but it does help to have a heavy sided pot.  the extra material helps distribute the heat more evenly. but more importantly all the handles and lid components need to be oven safe.\ni use a SS \"dutch oven\" more often than my enameled cast iron.  its just 4? qt pot that is wide than it is tall.  Think like a tall pasta pot cut in half.  Used it to braise beef earlier this week."

        "body": "Hi :)\nI\u2019ve been getting more and more into cooking lately. For years I was mostly the \u201cheat up ready-made meals\u201d type.\nI\u2019d love a rice cooker because I really hate cooking rice, but I\u2019d like to eat it more often. Right now my go-to side for most meals is usually just pasta.\nIf a device could take that off my hands and maybe also steam vegetables, or even cook potatoes, that would be amazing. I\u2019d also really like to make sushi. In general, I love Asian food.\nIdeally I want something that\u2019s as low-effort as possible.\nWhen I make rice at the moment, I usually mix it with vegetables that I pan-fry, then add tomato sauce, soy sauce, or a creamy sauce.\nFrom a quick Google search, I keep seeing Zojirushi and Tiger.\nAre those really the gold standard and worth investing in right away, or is that overkill for someone who\u2019s still a bit of a beginner in the kitchen?\nThey also seem harder to get in Germany (my country), and I\u2019m wondering if as a beginner I\u2019d even notice the differences.\nI\u2019m willing to spend more if it genuinely adds value. Main thing is I want to cook a wider variety of meals :)\nWould love to hear your thoughts.",
        "top_comment": "Zojirushi is hard to find in the EU since they only produce rice cookers for the 120V grid. Been a while since I looked it up, but I think it was Yum Asia that used to import them and make 240V conversions. They eventually moved into producing and selling their own rice cookers, and just looking at the feature list and price, their line-up is probably the closest to feature parity - like induction heating or fuzzy logic.\nThat said, the most high-end rice cooker isn't necessarily the best. It'll\nprobably\nmake better rice than a cheaper one, but not certainly so much better you'll tell the difference outside of just rice in a side-by-side comparison. Also, things like non-stick bowls and rubber seals wear out about as fast, but are more expensive to replace for the more expensive devices.\nWhen I bought a rice cooker (for much the same reasons you have) I looked at all the options, thought deeply about it, and then just impulse bought whatever I spotted in my local shop. Ended up with a Xiaomi smart cooker, which has some QoL issues, but does cook rice perfectly every time."

My husband suggested home-made kebabs or gyros, but again, we have no idea what spices there will be to use!\nOf course we can do very simple things, like bangers and mash with the potatoes we will already be buying for the pie, or a fry up (but we already do that a lot at home), but we would like something more involved aside from cutting up potatoes and frying some sausages.

Would this be more viscous than heavy cream but more neutral in flavor (less sour) than sour cream?",

I tossed them into my dehydrator for a few hours, then ran them through my (cleaned) coffee grinder.\nWhat resulted was the fluffiest powder I\u2019ve ever seen, almost a like powdered sugar. It\u2019s also one of the most versatile and delicious things I have in my seasoning cabinet now. Whenever I make a sauce, stew, gravy, or similar, I add a tablespoon or so of this stuff. It\u2019s an amazing thickener, and a huge hit of umami.

Was this subversion by the \"Red Chinese\" cleverly disguised as marketing? lol ... but TikTok was to debut 52 years later ...\nThe video reassuringly stresses the modernity and sanitation of the production process. This was a concern when considering \"foreign\" or \"exotic\" foods.\nThe chef character cites the yield at the start of each of his demonstrated recipes. Put yourself in the housewife's position: \"four to six servings\" ... why, the recipe would be perfect for your nuclear family!\nShowcasing La Choy brand \"Chinese\" food thoroughly Americanized so as to be intriguing yet accessible, the recipes are simple and straightforward, eminently doable in any American kitchen. Other than soy sauce and bean sprouts, nothing is particularly \"foreign\" or \"exotic\"; the chef even calls his wok a \"Chinese cooking pan\".\nNice cameo by old-school Pyrex measuring pitcher!\n\"Thirty minutes? My customers are going through the roof right now! In thirty minutes they'll be in orbit!\" The waiter character uses the word \"orbit\", because of course he does. It was '64, we were in the middle of a Cold War and a Space Race; everybody knew the scientific technical term \"orbit\".\nI appreciate the chef explaining that chop suey is not Chinese at all.\nIncidentally I also noticed, because this is\n/r/Cooking\nafter all, that neither the chef character, nor the \"girl\" character who demonstrates more recipes in the second half, whatever role she plays in the restaurant, doesn't use excessive heat, the bane of so many amateur home cooks, even in his \"Chinese cooking pan\".\nWhen the waiter character objects the recipes look like they can't be done in a typical American kitchen, the chef holds up one of those \"handy sealed containers\", cans, obviously, but if you look closely it's a special can. It's actually two cans taped together, something La Choy pioneered for its canned Chow Mein product. The meat and sauce were in the smaller can on top and the vegetables in the larger on the bottom. Was this borne of production logistics, or was it a Bernays-style \"add an egg\" ploy to make the American housewife feel she's actually cooking rather than just opening a can?\nOh look, La Choy even has a recipe and suggestion book! Where can I get one?\nThe remaining demonstrated recipes are done in a modern American kitchen. No \"Chinese cooking pans\".\nYMMV but that bacon-wrapped water-chestnut, pineapple, and chicken liver plate would be perfect for Bridge Night. I need to get multi-colored toothpicks.\nThe girl character sings the virtues of \"Chinese\" food as low-calorie (yes they had diet fads aplenty even then) and high in protein, but also as a \"meat-stretcher\", not some device that you'd prank the FNG with but something to add meat to to make a fuller meal, like Hamburger Helper was to do in the early 1970s.\nSpeaking of dietary fads, keep an eye out for sugar in the recipes. After Ike had his heart attack in '55 there was a massive push to vilify fat and lionize sugar, as Adam Conover would be happy to ruin for you.\nAdditionally, mentioning she can get all the provisions she needs for dinner in one place, even one shelf, surely takes the drudgery out of shopping for your family. No need to make separate stops at the butcher and greengrocer (which was a thing in the '60s before the all-in-one \"Super-Market\" became the norm).\nThe background music switches from traditional Chinese-style music to flutey jazz for the rest of the video. This is the hardcore-sell part of the video where the girl demonstrates some serious Chinese-influenced recipes that the American housewife can realistically use.\nThe \"sumptuous\" Mandarin salad looks positively awful, ngl. And mayonnaise? Always with the mayonnaise. Nice cameo by a yellow Pyrex glass mixing bowl, though. Those go for a pretty penny at mid-century antique malls.\nCheck out the Hall Rose Parade pitcher to the left of the coffee station!\nScrambled eggs \"\nOrientale\n\"? French-Asian fusion egg foo young? What would Jacques Pepin think?\nIdk about boiling chicken for what basically amounts to a chicken stew, but ... Hello Revere Copper Clad saucepan!\nCute ending, waiter wants to take girl on a dinner date, but with Women's Lib just around the corner she insists on making it herself for them at her place. Chinese pizza? I'm intrigued...\nSomeone once said that immigrants conquer us with their food.\nBut my favorites pieces of trivia about La Choy brand specifically are (1) La Choy was started by Ilhan New and Wally Smith, and (2) The three owners of La Choy, all Americans, appeared on\nWhat's My Line\nand nobody guessed they made Chinese food!",

        "body": "Is investing hundreds in quality utensils cook really necessary or just pretentious for a home cook? I've cooked with cheap dollar store tools my entire adult life and survived without any major disasters or injuries. My friend who's a chef insists proper tools transform cooking but she cooks professionally so of course she would say that naturally. Would better spatulas and knives actually improve my mediocre cooking skills or is that wishful thinking? My family doesn't complain about my meals so maybe my tools are adequate for our needs already. The cost of replacing everything properly would be significant, easily five hundred dollars for basics which seems excessive. That money could go toward groceries for months instead of tools that might not make any noticeable difference. My cheap knives are dull but they still cut eventually with enough effort and pressure applied. My spatulas bend but they still flip pancakes even if it's awkward and frustrating sometimes. Is my frustration worth hundreds of dollars or should I just accept cooking isn't my passion and adequate tools are sufficient? My sister upgraded her kitchen and raves about the difference constantly saying she actually enjoys cooking now. Maybe there's something to this that I'm dismissing too quickly without properly considering the benefits. Quality tools supposedly last decades while I replace my cheap ones annually which adds up over time financially. I found professional kitchen tools on Alibaba at reasonable prices but I'm still debating if this is justifiable.",

I'm an experienced cook, though this is my first foray into homemade pasta.\nFollowing a few recipes I saw, I made a well with three cups (spooned into a one cup measuring cup) all-purpose flour and four eggs. I stopped at three since it overflowed the well and mixed the flour in. It didn't become dough at all, but basically egg drop soup on my counter. I had to add more and more flour to simply make the dough. I finally got it to form a dough using all four eggs and probably another cup of flour, and let it rest. No matter what I did, it fell apart in the pasta roller. Added water, even a drop of oil, and it still fell apart, even when the consistency seemed right. I finally gave up and cut some strands just to try it, put it in salted water, boiled for two minutes, and....nothing. It dissolved into the water entirely, not a single strand was left, simply dough water.\nWhat went wrong? Could the flour be bad?",

I\u2019ve never been to Nepal, but my girlfriend has; she always talks about how \u201cpotato and cheese momos\u201d from there are the best thing she ever eaten. We can\u2019t find anywhere near us that sells them, so I thought I\u2019d try to make some for her for Valentine\u2019s Day. I\u2019m just looking for some advice or feedback on how these turned out. I\u2019ve never had them before, so I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re supposed to look or taste like (obviously you can\u2019t taste them unfortunately! \ud83d\ude05). I\u2019ve asked a couple of people and was told that the recipe I used is most likely to be similar to what she would have had while backpacking there. I\u2019m worried they won\u2019t be anything like she remembers though! If anyone happens to have been to / lives in Nepal and knows exactly what she may be referring to when she says, \u201cpotato and cheese momos\u201d, I\u2019d love your advice!

        "top_comment": "Just to clarify (because there has long been a misunderstanding with the term),\nvelveting\nspecifically refers to coating thin slivers of meat with a thin coating of starch (cornstarch/potato starch/etc., usually along with egg white and oil) that is solidified by passing through either hot oil or hot water for a few seconds, which creates a starch barrier that reduces moisture loss of the meat slivers and also creates that\nvelvety\nmouthfeel.\nThe marinating with baking soda step is something else entirely - that is simply\ntenderising\n.

It's just a slippery gelatinous goo but very decadent, good with rice or noodles. What I will say is that we go 60 minutes in a pressure cooker (not slow cooker) and we don't go to extreme lengths to clean or trim it. You'll also need strong components to balance it. Our main additions are ginger, Chinese white cooking wine, green onions during the pressure cooking part or a soy sauce braise with ginger, shaoxing wine to balance the smell. Recommend following some Asian recipes if you can and making sure you cook it LONG enough to break it all down.  Try again! Good luck!"

I'm thinking a young Chianti poured into a big mason jar with fresh sage, rosemary, bay leafs, leaf celery, maybe some juniper berries and pepper corns. And then just leave it in the fridge for 3-4 days.\nWould this be a worthy additional step or does the usual marinade  work enough as is?",

Most of those herbs (especially rosemary and bay) will release their oils pretty quickly once they\u2019re in contact with the wine and the meat anyway.\nIf anything, letting them sit in wine alone for 3\u20134 days might start pulling out some bitterness. A 24-hour marinade with everything together should be more than enough for both flavor and mellowing the gamey notes.\nSounds like a great project though \u2014 rag\u00f9 di cinghiale is worth the effort."

Or I\u2019d have to get a whole pie \u2014 not ideal for quick in and out, which is the only kind of eating out I do.\nIf I\u2019m requesting it, any instructions on reheating?

Then I toss it on a hot skillet/large pan for a couple min to crisp the bottom crust.\nSometimes this is better than when it was fresh.\nFor toppings its tougher to add to already cooked pizza since you'd overcook the slice while the toppings are cooking.   Broiler can help so its more top down and less overdoing the slice.\nKeep in mind, real pizza ovens are very hot, usually 2x a regular oven.   So its tougher to duplicate.\nFYI, I used to work in a pizza place for years (in NY)."

Do I use a wisk or just regular chopsticks? Like what would it even mean to have a lump in a glutinous rice texture thats amylase dominated. Every recipe I see either has water steaming or baking going on. I know that I need to mix regular rice flour and the glutinous rice flour in the little bag with the elephant picture.\nLike what is the cooking time necessary and do I have to use parchement paper or can I just place oil in the rice cooker like regular cakes.",

I remember that the batter was loose, the veg was uncooked until it went into the pan, and her food was eye-wateringly hot. (I'm from a very-spicy-food country and she just broke me.) I think there was a mixed sauce they were served with, to dip into.\nI know some of her food used tiny little dried fish that set my mouth on fire, but I can't remember if that was part of this. I don't think they were in the pancakes, but it might help to clarify region?\nI've googled over the years and tried to recreate it, but no luck so far!",

I used to add oil to my pasta water to avoid accidentally birthing a pasta brick, until someone told me that the noodles stick together with or without oil as long as you neglect to stir it. To my surprise, one good stir at the very beginning has been enough to prevent my noodles from coagulating in every pasta dish I\u2019ve made in the past few months, no oil required. The money I\u2019ll save!\nHere\u2019s what doesn\u2019t make sense to me:\nWhen pasta is dry or fully cooked, it isn\u2019t sticky at all. Put it in boiling water for ten seconds and your pasta has amassed into a single solid chunk. Normally when I think about fusing two non-sticky objects together, I imagine heating something to liquid state and then allowing it to cool on the desired point of adhesion, such as in welding. Obviously the pasta isn\u2019t being liquefied, but perhaps the softening + expansion of the noodles + reductions in surface area where the noodles touch create cool spots where the noodles can harden and fuse to each other? But even if that were true, it wouldn\u2019t explain why it only happens at the very beginning of the cooking process. Is it a coating on the pasta, maybe?\nTldr; dry and cooked pasta not sticky, why pasta stick?",
        "top_comment": "You are over thinking it. Simply, pasta has starch. This isn\u2019t welding. It\u2019s pasta. It\u2019s starchy. Pasta sticks together after draining primarily because surface starches, released during cooking, remain on the noodles and act as a natural adhesive as the pasta cools and dries slightly. This effect becomes more pronounced if the pasta sits without agitation or sauce. So to keep the stick away, you\u2019ve got to coat it with the sauce. Washing the pasta under water will remove the starch, causing the sauce not to stick. If you\u2019re doing a cold pasta salad, that\u2019s okay. But with a hot pasta, you\u2019ve gor to coat it with some of the sauce."

There is plenty of INCREDIBLY delicate knifework required in Western cooking. And, quite frankly, most of what you are thinking of regarding Japanese knife work is filleting, deboning, and garnishing. Western chefs do the exact same operations.\nOne more bit. Part of the reason why Japan has so many different knife shapes is because, historically, their steel was... rather shite. Look it up since a discussion of material science and geography is well beyond the scope of this, but it is similar to why their sword (and spear) construction differed so much from Europe and North Africa (and even, to a lesser degree, China and Korea). Specialized knives for specialized purposes and constructions to help compensate for a lower overall hardness/durability. Contrast that with Europe and North Africa which had, for the era, VERY good steel and you have a lot more multi-taskers."

I do frequently cook large amounts of things, like searing 10 chicken thighs, so I'd love something that is like a long griddle pan but has higher (ideally fairly straight) walls, as well as a smaller pan.\nAnyone have any recommendations?

It's about 8x10 inches with decent wall height - perfect for those big batches of chicken thighs you're talking about. The walls are definitely high enough for sauces and whatnot.\nFor something smaller, you could also check out the rectangular carbon steel pans from Matfer Bourgeat. They're pricy but really solid quality and the walls are nice and straight. I've used mine for everything from stir-fries to braising and it handles the heat distribution really well on induction. Just make sure to season it properely if you go the carbon steel route."

        "body": "I\u2019m doing a DIY fork n film for my husband\u2019s birthday to Ratatouille, where I serve the dish alongside the movie. The goal is to minimise the time I\u2019m away from the movie for prep, while serving food that is similar to the movie and also impressive food.\nI\u2019ve figured how to minimise breaks and kitchen time for most of the dishes, but am still undecided for Sweetbreads \u00e0 la Gusteau / \u201cSpecial order\u201d.\nTimeline:\n- 0 mins: movie start\n- 20 mins and 30 mins: I will be in the kitchen grabbing the other courses\n- 50 mins: \u201cspecial order\u201d needs to be served.\nI would like to substitute the \u201cspecial order\u201d. Instead of sweetbreads, I wanted to prepare a protein main that we have less frequently at home, so duck seemed like a good idea as I\u2019ve only made it a couple of times.\nThere\u2019s also an element of visual similarity. In the movie, the dish has a single piece of protein resting on some tentacles (which I will use green beans or mini asparagus), and a thick orange sauce is poured over it.\nThe idea I have: precook the duck breast (sear + oven) just before the movie. It would be resting for 30 mins on the counter, and since I\u2019m entering the kitchen at 30 min, I would put the duck in the oven (50-60deg Celsius) for the next 17-20 mins till the special order scene comes on. The sauce will be made and held in the warmer the whole time till required\nThe purpose of the question is to get opinions on how doable my duck idea is, if it\u2019s likey to go terribly I will stick to slow cook beef. It is less ideal because it doesn\u2019t resemble to dish in the movie, and also I frequently do beef rib stews, so not as much \u201cwow\u201d factor, but I\u2019m sure he will enjoy it just fine.",

Thing is, I don't want to use up all the gas on the stove by having it cook this long and since I have to prepare other ingredients for the week, it seems like too much effort.\nI wanted to know if it's food safe to blend carrot, celery, onions, garlic, parsley, leeks, peppers, maybe add some water boil it a little and store in the freezer or are the vegetable components going to cause it to spoil and unable to keep for more than a week? Also how can I add meat to the mix to make this more flavorful?",
        "top_comment": "You can certainly freeze a veggie puree, which is what you would be making. You will not have anything resembling a stock.\nIf you want a stock, I would recommend either buying stock, buying bullion cubes (which will very quickly make water taste like store stock), or if you want to avoid the stove, doing it in an oven, if that's an option for you."

I make dinner regularly for my husband and me, but we tend to rotate the same meals, usually some variation of a quick 15-minute pasta. I\u2019ve always admired people who can confidently mix and match ingredients and seem to have fridges full of real food rather than meal kits or pre-prepared sides.\nI do own a few cookbooks, but I often find they don\u2019t help much when it comes to planning a weekly shop or building a well-stocked pantry.\nI\u2019m looking for a cookbook that will guide me in shopping at the start of the week and using those ingredients efficiently across multiple meals. I don\u2019t mind if the recipes take a bit longer. In fact, I\u2019m looking forward to being more intentional with my cooking.\nThanks so much for any recommendations!",
        "top_comment": "There is no such thing (and anyone who claims otherwise is just taking advantage of you). In large part because the entire point of being \"an ingredients household\" is to shop the discounts and seasons and so forth. This is actually WHY so many cuisines have regional variants. Most people are aware of \"American Chinese Food\" (also \"Canadian Chinese Food\" and \"British Chinese Food\" and so forth). They aren't as aware that \"Chinese Food\" in Guangdong versus Zhejiang are going to be VERY different in large part because of the available ingredients and how that shifts flavor profiles.\nSo what you actually want to do is twofold:\nFirst, you should learn how to cook a wider variety of recipes. Rather than go pick up the ingredients for that weeknight meal, you should instead check the weekly circular for what is on sale or pay attention to what produce looks healthier. Then do some googling to see what kinds of recipes you can make with that... and make them.\nThe second is to learn what you are adding to a dish and why. Kenji's The Food Lab is still amazing for this as is Nosrat's Salt Fat Acid Heat. Make the dishes but also make it a point to taste the spices you are adding and read about suggested alternatives.\nOnce you have those two down? You are still \"following recipes\" to a degree but you might make it with one protein instead of another. Or you might change up the spices or sauces for a pasta dish and so forth."

It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been nervous about cooking but I want to try something new. So my question is what\u2019s a good steak to use for an Alfredo pasta and what are some tips on how to cook it so it\u2019s not tough and it\u2019ll be nice and soft for the pasta?",
        "top_comment": "Steaks like ribeye tend to be very forgiving when it comes to \"overcooking\" as they have a lot of fat on them. Much more so than a filet which if cooked past med-rare tend to be tough.\nGet a pan ripping hot, little oil in the pan and sear it hard. You can cook it completely on the stove, or toss the pan in the oven to get it to your preferred temp. Let it rest for 1/3 to 1/2 as long as you cooked it for before slicing."

Other recipes suggested a lower temp like 275\u00b0, 300\u00b0.

I've tried to look them up but google keeps coming back with the shredded variety.\nThanks!",
        "top_comment": "I think they're still hash browns, just the potato shreds are less intact than what you're thinking of for hash browns. My guess is the potatoes are grated with an industrial size food processor, which leaves them more crumbly than if you shredded them on a mandoline with a julienne blade.\nTo my mind, \"hash browns\" is a pretty broad category with a lot of different styles. My favorite is the kind that's shredded but still intact potatoes like you're thinking, but sometimes for sure it's more like a giant flat deep fried tater tot (fast food style), sometimes it's a bit more crumbly/mashed and comes out like a potato pancake (like your photo), and sometimes it's cubed potatoes cooked in a skillet. I'm always a little disappointed with that last kind, because I think of those as \"breakfast potatoes\" and it's not what I want when I order \"hash browns\". But then if you get \"corned beef hash\" pretty much 100% of the time it's going to be those cubed potatoes, so to me they are all valid variations of \"hash browns.\""

Browned on the stove for 8 min or so before adding buff sauce until it was all soaked in and caramelized.\nMade up a salad w ranch dressing, combined in a wrap w the tempeh.\nSurprisingly yummy.

        "top_comment": "The thing to remember is that \"stir fry\" isn't a dish, it's a cooking technique, like steaming or stewing. It means cutting the food into the right size and shape so that it cooks fast in the high temperature of the wok.\nThis is why you see recipes for \"stir fried cabbage\" or \"stir fried beef in black bean sauce\". In Chinese cooking, you're more likely to have 2-3 stir fried dishes on the table, most with just one main ingredient, rather than the western idea of putting everything into a single dish.\nToo many ingredients in the wok makes it all a bit soupy."

I think it's pretty dang good, but every once in a while I consider adding other seasonings. Not replacing what I have, just adding on to it to see what happens. Experiment.\nI've tried garlic (granulated, as I'm too lazy to try to do it \"right\"), but didn't feel like it added anything. It didn't take away from the flavor, it just didn't improve it at all. I also tried ground nutmeg once and really didn't like it. Right now I'm considering either ground mustard, celery salt, or maybe sage or thyme?? I'm not sure about those two though. Dunno how they'd pair with dill. What would you add?\nRough recipe:\n- Shrimp\n- Pasta (medium shells or cavatappi work best imo)\n- Flour & Butter for a roux\n- Chicken stock (see below)\n- Salt & white pepper to taste\n- Heavy cream\n- Lemon juice\n- Parmesan (not the stuff in the can)\n- Dill\nPrepare your shrimp. I prefer to buy the frozen, pre-copkwd, peeled & deveined because again, lazy. So for me this involves thawing and removing the tails.\nCook your pasta. I prefer either medium shells or cavatappi with this.\nAdd your shrimp to your pasta for however long whatever shrimp you bought takes to cook.\nDrain the pasta.\nMeanwhile, make the sauce:\nMake a roux, then add chicken stock (you could use white wine or veggie stock, I just use chicken because it's almost always in my pantry). At this point, I add salt and white pepper, plus whatever addon I'm experimenting with (if I am).\nAdd a bit of heavy cream. I usually go around the pan 1.5 times.\nOnce that thickens, add lemon juice.\nAdd Parmesan. I prefer shaved over grated. Add as much as your heart desires or your guts allow. (if your sauce is too thick, add some pasta water)\nOnce the parm is incorporated, add your pasta & shrimp. Mix slightly\nTop with a GENEROUS amount of dill. Add some extra Parmesan if it makes you happy.\nMix well. Allow to sit for a few minutes.\nEat.",

        "body": "I love cooking and it has been my hobby for years. I have tried many methods and apps over the years for saving and organizing recipes. It can be hard to find something that ticks all the boxes of preserving a recipe, allowing me to take notes or modify it, and making it so that I can actually remember what I've made that my family likes when it is time to plan groceries. I have been using a mind-map tool (mindomo is the one I use, but there are many others) for many years now and it is the closest thing I have found. But it is starting to get a little unwieldly now though (probably just needs a thorough go-through/cleaning up).\nHas anyone else found some sort of strategy that works better?",
        "top_comment": "Mine is pretty old fashioned.  I have a 3 ring binder.  I print out recipes when I have decided they are good enough that I want them handy.  I have a plastic sheet protector attached to the fridge via magnet.  When I want to use a recipe, I put it in the sleeve.  It keeps it clean, easy to look at, and I can make notes in dry erase. Sometimes I just steal the magnet and make notes in pen.  I keep a file called \"cookbook\" on my computer.  It has all of the same recipes in it.  If I decide I want my changes to be permanent, I update the file and print a new copy for my binder\nI collect recipes on Allrecipes, and Pinterest.  The ones I use most end up in the physical book and my cookbook file, but it's nice to be able to get to them from the internet.  I use Our groceries for my family's groceries, and usually just input what I need by hand.  I tend to keep a lot of staples, so if I'm baking I usually just need one ingredient.  Cooking is more likely to add a lot to the grocery list, but that's because I usually buy fruit and veggies determined by what is cheap that week.\nThis'll either help or make you think \"thank goodness I'm not\nthat\nall over the place!\""

The total weight is 2.5 kg, but the fillets are compressed into one solid square block about 5 cm thick, with no clear separation lines.\nI was recommended to thaw the frozen block in refrigerator and than separate the meat into 100 g or 150 g portions for meal prep and than re-freeze them again.\nOr perhaps to cut the frozen block into 150g portions with some sort of stainless steel serrated knife for frozen meat?\nIt's not a must to to preserve whole fillets, more importantly to portion it by weight.\nI have a more than one frozen block of chicken breasts. This is how I did with the first block:\nI thawed the block only in the refrigerator. It was wrapped in plastic wrap, placed on a plate, and kept in a closed lower fridge drawer. Total thawing time was about 30 hours. The meat stayed cold, but the center was still partially frozen and very firm.\nBecause the fillet boundaries were not visible, I did not try to separate individual fillets. Instead, I cut the block by weight. I sliced it into slabs and then into smaller portions.\nFor cutting, I used a regular kitchen knife. It did not work well on the firm center.\nAfter portioning, I packed the portions separately, removed air, and re-froze them again after about half an hour.\nMy main questions are:\n-Is it possible or a good choice to cut and frozen block into portions with some sort of knife for frozen meat so I could avoid the thawing and re-freezing process altogether?\n-Is thawing raw chicken in the fridge for ~30 hours and then re-freezing it acceptable if it stayed cold the entire time?\n-Is cutting a dense, partially frozen block by weight (not along fillet lines) a reasonable approach in terms of quality loss?\n-Is using a serrated kitchen knife acceptable here, or does it significantly damage texture compared to normal thawing and cutting?\n-I\u2019m mainly concerned about food safety and whether any quality loss from this approach is meaningful for everyday chicken breast cooking.\nThank you!",
        "top_comment": "Whew! Lots of questions here. I\u2019ll bypass the fridge option, and ask that you consider thawing the chicken in a large pot (or even your sink) of cold water. Refresh the water every 30-45 mins. In a few hours you should be able to portion the chicken.\nI would not advise trying to cut it frozen. In the above process, the edges will defrost fastest, and can cut your portions, or simply wait until it more thawed to cut it all at once. If you want to refreeze, I find this method keeps the quality of the chicken intact, with less moisture loss=higher quality."

I talked to his pediatrician about it and he said, \"Feed him what you eat.\" When I resisted he said, \"If you don't switch it up now you'll be in my office when he's 13 years old, still cooking separate meals.\"\nSo I did. I always made beautiful gourmet meals for me and my (ex)husband so I started feeding the same to him. And this stubborn lil boy went on a\n3 day hunger strike.\nHe almost broke me. Just as I was about to give in on day 4 he just slid up to our table and calmly ate dinner with zero drama. Not a single problem with food since. He doesn't necessarily love every meal I make but he understands that's just life. And if he truly can't tolerate a thing he knows there's always food he can make, like noodles or sandwiches.\nThe most hilarious thing to me is that he's 18 now and wants to go to culinary school.

I've found that many people can't afford to make the lasagna themselves (time, effort, financials can all stand in the way), and are looking for that classic lasagna experience rather than a riff on it.\nMost recipes are pretty straightforward, and the variations come in the ingredients. You definitely don't want to deliver something you haven't tried yourself, though, so if you try a new sauce, make sure it works...and that you got your recipe from a\ntrusted\nsource!\nI offer an alfredo version (chicken or veg) for seniors and pregnant/new moms in case indigestion and heartburn is an issue.\nI offer meat, meat and veg or just veg.\nWith ingredients on hand, you can easily swing a southwest style (beans for protein, salsa instead of marinara, includes corn, chiles and cheddar blend) if the family is open to it.\nI make my marinara from scratch, and bechamel.  A guy in my district makes his own ricotta- super easy and a fun way to change it up.\nIf there's kids in the home, a 'pizza' version is fun (minimal bechamel, use pepperoni/sausage and any of their fave pizza toppings).\nI make a bunch at a time and freeze them, and deliver them frozen (as long as the neighbor in need has a way to bake/reheat it, I usually just deliver assembled/unbaked).  Filling my kitchen with a dozen lasagnas is kinda fun and gets allll the work done at once, and then I can bake something additional each time to drop off with the families (pumpkin bread, cookies, coffeecake, homemade rolls).\nIf anyone else is looking for information on what Lasagna Love is and how you can help in your community, you can DM and I'll be happy to give information, or sign up at\nhttps://lasagnalove.org/volunteer/\nNo commitment, you volunteer on your own schedule and availability....you can even do it just one time only.  Don't have time to participate?  You can donate to volunteers in your area to help offset the costs.  And don't hesitate to spread the word...Lasagna Love is in all 50 states, in Canada, Australia and now the UK- there are no borders on kindness, and the simple act of a homemade meal delivered to the doorstep of a family is incredibly powerful on both sides."

        "body": "Hello all! I really would actually appreciate any help so much. I have been buying this milk cream bread from these two Korean French bakeries in the US-Tour Les Jour & Paris Baguette!! For years, I have been saying it\u2019s time for me to replicate and make my own. Well, now is the time. The thing is, the bread is the most pillowy soft almost steamed like bun. Clearly, it\u2019s just a tad bit underbaked. I feel like the bun part I can do. I will be using the Tangzhong method and I will be putting milk powder in the buns as well. The part that I\u2019m struggling with, is the milk cream filling to be clear, this is not a bread that has the typical whipped cream filling. It\u2019s a milk cream. I feel like it\u2019s got some type of specific texture that I haven\u2019t been able to find in other places, almost cream cheese texture, but it\u2019s not cream cheese tasting, and not exactly as firm as it either. I\u2019m confused on whether to use condensed milk, milk powder, whole milk, whipping cream, cream cheese, mascarpone. Honestly, it could be just milk, which has been heated with cornstarch to produce that texture that I\u2019m talking about. I know the taste needs milk powder. So, any tips and tricks for helping me re-create this bread perfectly it would be phenomenal, thank you so much!!!",
        "top_comment": "Oh man I've been obsessed with those breads too! You're totally right about that specific cream texture - it's like this weird middle ground between pastry cream and cream cheese\nI'm pretty sure it's a combination of milk powder, some condensed milk for sweetness, and yeah probably cornstarch or even custard powder to get that thickness without being too heavy. The trick is probably cooking it just enough to thicken but keeping it light and airy. I've seen some korean bakery copycat recipes use a tiny bit of mascarpone mixed with the milk base to get that creamy mouthfeel without the tanginess\ndefinitely post an update when you figure it out because I've been wanting to try makeing these at home forever"

I hate to use this as an example but the closest thing I could think of is when I was a kid, my family would take food to a family in need and their home smelled awful, like a combination of old food and a bathroom that had never been cleaned.\nI thought maybe the food had just gone bad, but something about it made me suspicious that either the ham hocks or the salt pork was to blame.\nLater, I made a gumbo, which I do about every two months. This time I opted for pricier andouille sausage, and I noticed when I cut into it that it was very fatty. \u201cGreat,\u201d I thought, but once the gumbo was simmering I got a very slight whiff of that disgusting smell, even as it cooked. (It was so faint I wasn\u2019t sure I had smelled it or if it was just in my head. I tried to get my wife to smell it but she didn\u2019t notice).\nThe gumbo tasted fine after the simmer, and perfect the next day. But I can\u2019t help but think that the fatty andouille was throwing off some funk.\nIs this a thing, or am I overthinking it?",

So I'm thinking a 5qt one? Any thoughts on enameled vs not? I'm leaning towards it but would love to hear more opinions.\nIt seems like Smith & Clark has exactly what I'm looking for, but the more research I do, the more mixed the reviews are. Anyone have one that they love or hate or something in between? TIA!",

        "body": "About six years ago, well before the world changed with COVID, I began to lose my ability to smell and taste. I can still sense the basics like sweet, sour, salty, spicy, or bitter, but it\u2019s just a faint signal, a sense rather than a full experience. After seeing a number of doctors who couldn't provide a medical solution, I\u2019ve simply learned to accept it as my reality. This loss isn't just about missing out on flavor; it\u2019s a safety issue. My wife has come home to the smell of gas because I\u2019ve accidentally bumped a stove knob without a flame catching. I\u2019ve since installed several gas sensors throughout the house.\nDespite this, I haven't given up on the joy of cooking or eating. I\u2019ve just changed the rules of the game.\nMy culinary exploration now centers mostly on texture and structure of the food I eat. Crunch, crispness, and firmness are what define a successful dish in my kitchen. When I cook pasta, it must have enough of an al dente body to roll firmly around my mouth so I can identify the specific shape and origin through feel alone. Vegetables are treated with the same rigor, they must maintain their own defined structure after cooking because I simply cannot tolerate mushiness. Every bite needs to provide some sort of tactile feedback to make up for what I cannot taste. Meats are prepared with a specific focus on firmness. A properly prepared medium-rare steak is of sensory importance. The contrast between the seared exterior and the yielding center \"roars\" in my mouth in a way that goes beyond mere taste. Breads have become equally vital to my daily experience. I find genuine satisfaction in the crannies of a toasted English muffin, the dense elasticity of a bagel, or the pillowy softness of a fresh-baked loaf. At the same time, I\u2019ve learned to navigate the savory \"umami,\" I can sense, though I have to be careful when cooking for others. What feels like a necessary boost of sensation to me can easily overpower a guest\u2019s palate.\nThere is so much more I\u2019m discovering every day by treating my palate to new textures and senses.",

Usually this works like a charm and I've made it for a large group before.\nHere's the issue. I'm\nrelatively\nexperienced and have made this recipe before for this large a group. So I will often eye stuff and taste as I go and things work great. But I kept tasting this sauce (a new spoon every time because I'm not a savage), and it just keeps tasting ... off. Definitely bitter/too strong or something. Maybe too salty? I tried to sweeten with mirin and even honey but no improvement. My working theory: wayyyyyy too much garlic/ginger. I sometimes go overboard with this and I don't measure this part usually. Could also have burned the aromatics slightly but I don't think so because the stuff didn't brown. Third theory is the oil I used - sunflower seed oil that was slightly cloudy - was off?\nBut now I have gallons of this stuff and 24 hours to fix it. Should I:\nStart over -its fast and easy to make and I can afford it.\nTry to \"thin out\" the garlic and ginger in the recipe by adding more of the mirin, soy and sake solution.\nAdd more sugar/mirin/honey only.\nIt doesn't taste BAD... Just not...great. and it's usually great!\nThanks in advance for any advice you can give.",

I gave up on using it that day.\nToday I tried again. Again it took way longer to cook, and when i got the food out the smoke (even if not much, the usual amount i would say) made my eyes burn, they were so red and i cried, i had to wash them and even now they still hurt even if it's been half an hour.

        "body": "I\u2019ve always detested the flavor of jarred pasta/marinara sauces for the reasons I\u2019m sure everyone here can relate to. They basically taste like ketchup to me. When I want to taste/make an authentic Italian dish I imagine acidic, bright tomato flavors. But when I started trying to do things the right way a few years ago, it still didn\u2019t work. I bought various brands of \u201cthe right stuff\u201d - San Marzano, from Italy, etc., including what I would think would be the least likely to taste sweet- whole peeled SM tomatoes, from Italy, from the Italian brand here in the US everyone seems to love, Cento.\nI open the can and what do I taste? Ketchup!!!! of course I might be exaggerating a little bit but still, it was far, far sweeter than what I wanted.\nWhat am I missing here?? I would so love the option to have something bright and acidic out of a can and be able to very mildly sweeten the final sauce with a tiny bit of sugar, if I want to. But this doesn\u2019t seem to be an option right now, and I would really like to avoid having to process my own tomatoes.\nThanks!",
        "top_comment": "Mostly, I think you might be missing a like of tomatoes. San Marzano tomatoes are on the sweet side, however They tend to be more low acid. Also, a lot of them are packed with a basil leaf or two in the can, and (to me, at least) basil is on the sweet side.\nI don't know what brand of canned tomatoes you have available to you. If you're in an area that sells Pastene (New England/Northeast at least), try Pastene Kitchen-Ready tomatoes the next time you try to make sauce. Don't add a lot of basil.\nIf you like a brighter, more acidic sauce, try to concentrate on flavors you think you'd like it in (maybe garlic, salt, black pepper, and chili flakes). You might add a splash of red wine, too. Taste as you go and see how you like it."

Burnt, completely black, but the \"cheese pull\" is nice. I used Cheddar and our local semi-hard cheese.\nMy second attempt - no butter, but added oil generously on the pan; 30 seconds from each side on low heat, then covered with a lid. Bread is dry and crispy, cheese didn't even melt.\nIs there some sacred knowledge on how to make a good grilled cheese? I've seen many videos on YouTube, and they all go like \"1-2-3 - ready\" without specifying many things, making it seem easy when it's not. Which type of bread is better? Is shredded cheese better than slices, even though it's inconvenient? Should I cover bread with butter from both sides? Maybe butter isn't needed at all? Should you lower the heat?

        "top_comment": "Danger is relative, but the science here is absolutely sound.\nThere's really no benefit to washing chicken from a supermarket because if you do your job right and cook the chicken properly, the heat will kill the dangerous bacteria and you're good. However, if you wash the chicken, it's exceedingly easy so splash contaminated water around which will NOT be cleansed by the heat of your cooking and linger where it can infect you or others through direct contact.\nChicken is objectively worse in this regard than other meats because it harbors more dangerous bacteria on average."

I'm going to make meatballs this evening with ricotta, mostly because we have a ton of ricotta and we need to use it up. When you make ricotta meatballs should I also \"soak\" the panko in the ricotta, like a milk+bread panade? Or will that not make much of a difference? This question is so specific I should also say: please use this post to discuss the different benefits and drawbacks of both methods.",

It was probably in the first recipe I read, but I've followed it since.\nNot only for meatballs, but if making sausages like bangers (in \"bangers and mash\" recipes) calling for rusk or bread crumbs, I also soak them in the cream or ricotta first for a while before incorporating them into the rest of the meat.\nIn my brain, this helps incorporation.

        "body": "I have previously always had a gas stove.  My current apartment has a radiant electric glass cooktop.  The large burners are 1,800W on the manufacture website.  If I want to cook pasta, or mashed potatoes, etc, anything that would boil water in my 10 qt stockpot...it pretty much can't boil water.  After 20-30 minutes with the lid on, it will read a low boil at best, but a roaring boil is not possible.  The small burners are rated at 1,200W and rapidly boil water in a 2 qt sauce pan.\nThe stove is an\nAmana\nwhich is specified to be connected to 120V/40A, so there is no chance there is something like a 240V stove running on 120V to be a problem.\nDo I just have a crap stove, or could something be wrong?  I see that even portable induction burners are more efficient than radiant electric at transferring heat, and so a 15 amp (1800W) induction burner would deliver more power than my stovetop.  Would it be worth getting a portable burner for high power needs?",

Normally I add them to salads or eat them plain with a bit of salt, but you can also sautee them or, even better, make a radish slaw like salad with radish and a lemon vinaigrette and some fresh herbs, even if it's just parsley.\nRoast your beets. Wrap 'em in foil at~400F for ~1hour. Let them cool a bit and the skins should slip right off. Now you have tons of options. I like them with feta and a little vinegar and oil, or pasta with brown butter, chopped up beets and some parmesan, or you can mash them, mix with ricotta, and make some easy ravioli with wonton wrappers. (Pan fry these in butter... mmm.)\nThe squash you cut into slices, toss with oil and salt and roast in the oven. You don't need to bother skinning it."

One thing that's easy is pasta with a sauce you don't have to cook separately.\nI like cooking pasta while I put parmesan, mascarpone and an egg yolk with pepper and mix it. Once the pasta is al dente, take it out, drain the water, put it back into the hot pot, and mix in the sauce until it melts. Much better than store-bought Mac'n'cheese.\nOr mix a Tablespoon each of peanut butter, soysauce and water, half a clove of garlic, crushed or minced, 1 Teaspoon of Gochujang (or another hot sauce) and half a teaspoon of honey in the soup plate, then put the pasta on it and mix it.\nI'm also fond of\ncucumber salad, Korean style\n.\nAs far as motivation is concerned, you usually save money and eat better when you cook yourself."

Some people dredge with lil flour and seasoning and pan fry it little in oil, then deglaze the pan with wine of broth to remove the fond.  Roasts can be cooked whole and tend to get plenty of maillard reaction from the roast process.  But simply simmering in a pot of soup you get none of those.  A little extra work and cleaning one frying pan goes a long way of bringing the flavor to a soup"

It seems silly to carefully slice all those onions only to later dice them anyway.",

This will probably use around 8 gallons for these three, but we're stumped on what else we could make.\nWe plan to make more cheese than whats needed for the bread, as well as double the amount of condensed milk to save, and a lot of ice cream (since it'll be for 30+ people, staff, AND different kinds) but we're still going to have at least 15 gallons if we double/triple stuff.\nAny and all recommendations are welcome and much appreciated!\nEdit:\nSome people mentioned freezing the milk, but unfortunately that is not an option for us. Others have mentioned taking the milk to all kinds of shelters, food banks, and even other facilities. The latter we likely won't get permission for, as the closest facility (owned by the same company) is about an hour away, and it's unlikely that anyone would be willing to make the trip (we also need permission from the administrator and possibly hr). As for the former, while I would like to go this route and donate the milk, as previously stated, we would need permission, and I think it's highly unlikely that they would allow it, based off of previous experiences.\nThank you all for the suggestions!

It's also much more cloudy than I'm used to.\nI'm mostly worried about texture.\nShould I alter the amount of stock that I'm putting into my soups?

This usually takes upwards of 8-10 hours depending on size. A full packer brisket (with both flat and point muscles) will take much, much longer; it usually goes overnight and I set alarms so I can make sure my smoker has pellets and is maintaining temp. My advice is to make sure you\u2019re monitoring the internal temperature."

Flour and milk also thickens when cooled.\nThat said, here\u2019s how. \ufffc\nFIRST Turn your oven on before you start the gravy to the temperature you need for making biscuits.\nI\u2019m not gonna tell you how to make your biscuits. That\u2019s for another time. I make my own biscuits or I used Pillsberry biscuits in a roll. They work fine.\nMake your gravy \ufffc\ufffc\nBrown crumbled sausage. Don\u2019t leave it in small chunks. Crumble it. You can do that in a couple ways. One is to just go chop chop chop chop chop chop chop with two spatulas as it cooks. The other way is to brown your sausage first and then let it cool in the refrigerator and then it will crumble easily in your fingers. You\u2019d have to do that even before you warm up your oven for biscuits\n\ufffc2. Once your crumbled sausage is heated to a light sizzle, \ufffcdrop in a generous pat of butter to your liking. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir it in until it is melted. Thus: roux\nAdd a small amount of flour like a level tablespoon. Stir it  around until  it is absorbed and let it cook that way for a minute or two stirring constantly to cook the taste of flour out of it.\n\ufffc Add a splash of milk to the pan and stir that in until you\u2019ve created a paste. \ufffcLet that cook for almost a minute.\nPut in approximately two heaping tablespoons of flour, adding more or less depending on how much gravy you wish to make. Gently stir that until you have gravy that\u2019s an acceptable consistency then add a little more milk to that so it\u2019s a little bit loose and thin  Let it simmer for about two minutes.\nRemove it from the heat and walk away. Go sit down somewhere and play on your phone. Maybe text your grandmother. Or better yet use that time to bake your biscuits. That should only take you about eight minutes maybe 12. \ufffcLet your gravy sit until it is cold and then a few more minutes after that. Now when you stick your wooden spoon into it you\u2019ll notice that it is a lot thicker than it was when it was loose and bubbling.\nPut the pan back on a gentle burner and pour a bit more milk on top and stir it in as it heats back up to a bubble, adding splashes of milk as necessary while you stir.\nIf you do that right, you\u2019re gonna have hot steamy white milk gravy that is not too thick, not too thin and completely full of crumbled sausage.\n8\ufffc. Personally, I do not add anything else to my gravy, except the sausage salt and pepper. I don\u2019t put in garlic powder or onion powder or any other herbs or spices. It just takes away from the delicious flavor of sausage, milk gravy. But you do you\nThank you for not asking \ufffc\ufffc",

In my head, it's something like the bulgur wheat from tabouleh and then adding things like tomato, cucumber, carrots, or whatever else you might want in there with whatever dressing appeals to you. You could also go with couscous, quinoa, barley, or even rice.\n- Cold pasta salads. I'm not really a fan but they're an easy option.\n- Leftovers but cold. One of my favorite sandwiches of all time is a cold meatloaf sandwich. Bread, yellow mustard, and meatloaf. Obviously won't appeal to everyone but the idea is to look at the dinners you make and see if there's a way to use some or all of it cold as a lunch.\nGood luck!"

Dal Bhati Churma is supposedly this iconic dish, but good luck finding it in restaurants at anywhere near the quality you'd get in someone's home. Most places either don't serve it or it's a sad tourist version.\nThis got me wondering, what other regional dishes are like this? Where the 'famous' food of an area is actually a home-cooking thing that restaurants can't or won't replicate properly? Is it the time investment, the techniques that don't scale, or just that some foods are meant to be made by grandmas and not commercial kitchens?\nI'd love to hear about dishes from your regions that fit this pattern.",

I've never made pernil before but I understand the skin is essential. Please accept my apology.\nWhat had happened was, I went to my neighborhood butcher and they didn't have any pork shoulder with skin. But the guy said that fatcap would be the same if I sear first, slow roast, and then turn up high heat at the end. This didn't sound right to me, but a) I've never made anything like this before and b) I knew I wouldn't have time to drive around town looking for another pork shoulder, I have a really busy day tomorrow and I already promised the crew pernil for super bowl.\nOk, so here she is, marinating. (You can also see she's kind of falling apart because they randomly cut it in the middle? So I had to tie it back together but didn't have enough twine. I swear I've never had a negative experience with this butcher before, I don't know what's going on.)\nHere are my questions:\nHe's wrong, right? This is just fat. There's no skin. Sear or no sear, it can't get crispy.\nSo what do I do with it? The recipe I'm following says to rub the skin with salt and baking powder now, then brush with achiote oil before roasting. Should I still do that with the fat cap?\nIf I don't have skin, should I just pressure cook it? I was going to roast it for the crispiness, but if there's no possibility of crispiness I'd rather save the time and trouble and do it in the instant pot, then shred and crisp in the oven like carnitas.\nThanks in advance for your help and please don't yell at me for this insult to pernil. Or do, I'm fine.\nETA: Forgot to include pic, apparently can't add it now, oops.",

Sure, cleaning a food processor is more work and more annoying than clean up would be for some other methods (although I'm guessing it's similar for a food mill), but the actual \"mashing\" took zero elbow grease and almost no time.\nA crucial note is that I used the fine grating disc, NOT THE BLADES. Once you feed the cooked potato into the processor, the \"grated\" potato falls into the basin, where it is not touched by anything again until you transfer it to a dish. The original idea came from when I had previously looked for creative alternatives to a ricer or mill and saw someone suggest using a microplane. I tried it once, and it worked great, just took a lot of time and an immense amount of effort. The food processor *with the grating disc* seemed like a potential way of doing the same thing, just automated. In practice, I think it probably didn't work too dissimilarly from a food mill, just where the grater itself is what spun instead of something on top of it, and where the spinning was operated by electricity instead of your arm.\nAnyways, long story short, I would highly recommend this method, especially for anyone that has any disability that affects grip or hand/wrist/arm mobility or anyone that simply hates the strenuousness of mashing a moderate to large quantity of potatoes.",

I wouldn't  use only jalape\u00f1os,  I  would also use poblanos. Broil your peppers to char them a bit, for the flavor. Peel them and chop them and add to the stock. Let it simmer a while, then thicken it a little or the cheese will turn to goo. Velvet Mexican and cream cheese added after you take it off the heat.

What I did not expect is that the main 'spice blend' of these soups is three heaping spoonfuls of red pepper flakes. I knew that korean food had some spice in it but it tickles me that at the end of making soondubu jigae, the recipe just says 'aight man now throw two fistfuls of chili flakes into that shit' and it somehow turns out well\nThe korean red pepper is very mild and kind of sweet, and I like how it adds this red color to a dish warning you that it's hot, but it's not too hot. That being said the quantities of red pepper flakes I've been using lately have been abnormal, I bought a kilogram of the stuff and im halfway through it after a week. Same with kimchi.\nAnyways korean food is honestly the bomb and I think everyone needs to give it a shot at cooking some of their favorite dishes.

I ran it through them a few times, lightly, without luck and with some more pressure which seems to have made it worse.\nI accept I might need to buy some new knives now, but can anyone recommend how to keep them in good shape with a nice smooth cutting edge? Is it just a case of regular weekly/monthly light sharpening?\nThanks",
        "top_comment": "Those pull through sharpeners are horrendous for your knives, genuinely genuinely way more harm than good.\nAt the stage it's at you need to sharpen it then hone it regularly to upkeep. Sharpening stones are what I'd recommend and get one of those clip on angle guides until you're proficient with getting the angle correct. A two sided 400/1000 stone is really all you need and you can watch tons of YT videos on how to use the stones.\nThere are also places that do it for $10-$15 a knife typically too if you'd rather do that for now while you get the gear to do it yourself and practice."

The videos I watch tell me to use salt pepper paprika and garlic  and I use about 100g diced chicken breast. I don't know if I'm using too much seasoning or maybe one seasoning is causing the bitter sour taste but I know the actual chicken is not the problem because  I get it from the same place my parents do and there chicken never taste  like mine . Also im cooking on a low med heat so im sure im not burning anything for it to come out tasting bitter like that. Any help would be appreciated thanks \ud83d\ude0a",

Because 100g of chicken is not a lot of chicken at all, and a\nsmall\npinch of all the seasonings should be enough to season the chicken. Even a full clove of garlic might be a little too much, although that shouldn't make it bitter or sour."

The key thing is don't just dump it straight in at the end, you want to add it early and let it cook down for at least a few minutes so the alcohol evaporates and the flavors concentrate. I usually add mine right after saut\u00e9ing garlic but before the cream goes in\nAlso taste your wine first before cooking with it - if it tastes funky or too acidic on its own it's gonna make your sauce weird. That Aldi sauvignon blanc is actually pretty decent for cooking, I've used it before. One last thing - save a splash to sip while you cook because cooking with wine is way more fun when you're also drinking wine lol. Your scallops are gonna be bomb with that wine reduction"

        "body": "Demoli Stewed Fish is a specialty dish of Heilongjiang. \"Demoli\" is a small fishing village by the Songhua River in Fangzheng County, Heilongjiang Province. The word \"Demoli\" is a transliteration of the Manchu language.\nDemoli village is very small. Since the village is located north of the Songhua River, the villagers here mainly rely on fishing for their livelihood. In the early 1980s, an elderly couple in the village opened a small restaurant by the roadside to entertain passers-by stopping to rest and eat. They stewed local live carp (grass carp, crucian carp, or catfish can also be used) together with tofu and wide starch noodles. The taste was delicious without losing the boldness of Manchuria cuisine, and more and more people came to eat, resulting in the business becoming increasingly prosperous.\nLater, the recipe for this dish spread like wildfire, and its reputation grew larger and larger. People from Harbin would often drive long distances, undeterred by the journey, specifically to Demoli to eat the local stewed fish. The fish used for Demoli Stewed Fish are all fresh live fish, only then can one fully enjoy the tenderness and deliciousness of the fish meat.\nThere are several indispensable conditions for Demoli Stewed Fish. First is fresh fish. The fish used is mostly carp or \"grass root\" (grass carp). The indispensable auxiliary ingredients for stewing the fish are brine tofu and starch noodles. It is rumored that the secret weapon of Demoli Stewed Fish is \"Maoba\". Stewed fish with Maoba added has a special flavor. The scientific name of Maoba is Agastache rugosa (wrinkled giant hyssop), which can be seen everywhere in the fields of Heilongjiang. When stewing fish, after the fish is in the pot, go to the vegetable garden to snap off a branch of Maoba and put it in the pot; the stewed fish will be incomparably delicious.\nIngredients Ingredients: One grass carp, black carp, or carp; one piece of brine tofu; a handful of starch noodles; Chinese cabbage; several slices of pork belly; some hazel mushrooms or shiitake mushrooms; one to two potatoes. Accessories: Two green chili peppers; small dried red chili peppers (must have, can put less if afraid of spiciness); one green onion; one piece of ginger; half a head of garlic. Seasoning: Salt, cooking wine, sugar, soy sauce, Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, cinnamon. Note: Legend has it that the seasonings for stewing fish also include Maoba (Huoxiang) and mountain pepper (Schisandra chinensis vine).\nPreparation Method\nFrying Wash the fish, score it, drain the water thoroughly, and fry it in oil or over high heat for three or four minutes.\nPreparing the Soup Adjust the amount of salt according to your own taste; cut the green onion into sections, do not chop it finely, as this can increase the aesthetic beauty of the whole dish; slice the ginger and peel the garlic. Put all the accessories into a mixing bowl and mix well. At this time, wash the hazel mushrooms and soak them in water. Cut the potatoes into chunks for later use.\nStewing the Fish After frying the fish, pour out the excess oil, pour the prepared soup base over the fish, and add the pork belly; add boiling water, the amount of water should cover the body of the fish but be lower than the edge of the large spoon, and stew over high heat; three to five minutes after the water boils, turn to low heat and stew for 20 minutes. (Note: The amount of water should not be too little. First, because the stewing time is long, and second, starch noodles will be added later, and the starch noodles absorb water.)\nAdding Ingredients After the fish has been stewing in the pot for about 25 minutes, add the starch noodles, potatoes, and hazel mushrooms. Do not let the starch noodles stick closely to the bottom of the pot to avoid sticking. After 10 minutes, add the tofu cut into large slices and the Chinese cabbage (the cabbage can be put in as whole leaves). After five or six minutes, turn off the heat and remove from the pot. Be sure to use a slightly larger basin to serve it, so that it is atmospheric enough to eat.",

        "body": "What\u2019s the difference? I noticed some recipes call for diced veggies or sometimes sliced, or even whole when doing for example stocks. My understanding is that what would change is the surface of contact (so probably time for cooking) and adding/removing texture. But is that about it? Are there more to it when deciding how to slice veggies when cooking? For some I can understand that flavour may change, but will it always be the case? And can an average home cooker notice the difference? Are there resources I could learn more about it?",
        "top_comment": "You have stated the difference in your question.\nTexture of the bite and surface area for the flavor to disseminate into the dish are the two variables for why you\u2019d chop things a certain way in a slow cook like stock.\nThe only other factor is sometimes you\u2019re supposed to pull out or strain and discard the ingredients at certain steps, which can be difficult if you cut them too finely."

I\u2019m hoping someone here can salvage my failure.\nI have a family New Mexican Style green chile recipe handed down to me with the requisite generational alterations. I\u2019ve made it so many times and tasted it even more that I just wing it and it always turns out great even if slightly different from prior iterations. I like to experiment and sometimes I get extra loose with it (and every recipe) when my inventory is limited.\nSo this time I\u2019m budget scrounging the kitchen and decide to whip up a batch. I\u2019m out of flour to thicken the stock. I\u2019m out of corn starch to thicken the stock. I pull so much shit out of my cupboards looking to thicken a bish that I stumble stumble on some ANCIENT pine nuts in the part of the top cupboard even the rodents can\u2019t reach.\nI love pine nuts. I know how they can stale out so I sample a couple. Doesn\u2019t seem so bad.\ndumps bag into stockpot\nNah turns out they\u2019re so stale not only does the entire batch of chile taste how I can only imagine powdered mummy bones to taste but the whole kitchen reeeeeks of funky nut dust.\nI added my backup apocalypse supply of dehydrated garlic (en polvo) and attempted to simmer out the nasty but it only seem to be further infusing with the goodness; subsuming it.\nUh\u2026 help? ALL APPROACHES WELCOME. Keep it traditional or get weird. I don\u2019t care I just want to eat it. I\u2019m half a step from dumping peanut butter powder and old ramen seasoning packets in there because I can\u2019t imagine it getting worse. Plus sometimes the only way out is through\u2026\nToo broke to throw it away. Love yall.\nEDIT: I ended up salvaging this dish after all! Spent an extra $2 on a brick of cream cheese and added some of that ground Parmesan that comes in the shaker (to try and add good nutty to bad nutty) and made it into a dip. Lil lime juice to brighten it and had it with tortilla chips. I could still taste the pine nuts but the stale-ness was 85% undetectable. 100% with the chips.\nThe batch ended up big enough for me to freeze some, so I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll work it into a chorizo potato casserole someday somehow.

Season the chicken with \u00bd teaspoon of salt and pepper.\nWorking in 2 batches if needed, place the chicken in the pan, skin side down. Sear until golden on both sides (about 8-10 minutes total), then remove the chicken. Remove all but two tablespoons of the bacon/chicken oil from the pan - reserving the oil to use later in the recipe.\nAdd the sliced onion and carrots to the pan and let them cook until the onion is golden brown, about 7-8 minutes. Add the garlic to the pan and let it cook for 1 minute.\n1 medium onion, 4 medium carrots, 4 cloves garlic\nPush the vegetables to the side of the pan and add the tomato paste. Cook the tomato paste until it is fragrant and begins to darken.

I\u2019d skip mashing whole oranges since the pulp and bitterness get messy fast. Start with fresh orange juice and zest, then gently reduce it with sugar until the flavor concentrates. For that jelly-like, gooey texture, a small amount of gelatin or pectin is your friend and way more predictable than guessing with starches. You want it set enough to pipe but still soft at room temp. Let it cool fully before filling the chocolates or it\u2019ll melt the shells. This route keeps the flavor bright and avoids that chalky cream filling you\u2019re trying to dodge."

The soup I am using is gelatinous bone broth so it would, in theory, re-coagulate once they've cooled in the refrigerator.\nI am leaning towards completely cooking them and letting them cool and covered in the fridge.

Any recommendations would be appreciated!",
        "top_comment": "You might want to look into hing (also called asafoetida). It\u2019s a spice used a lot in Indian cooking that gives a very onion-and-garlic-like savoury depth when it\u2019s cooked in oil, but it isn\u2019t actually an onion. A tiny pinch goes a long way, and the raw smell is strong, but once it hits hot oil it mellows into something surprisingly close to saut\u00e9ed onions in the background of a dish.\nSince you said shallots and scallions don\u2019t trigger your asthma, you could also combine a small amount of those with a pinch of hing to build a fuller \u201conion\u201d flavour without using regular onions at all. Just make sure to check the label, because some commercial hing powders are blended with wheat flour if that matters for you."

It overpowering the other flavours wouldn't be on his mind, at least not in this case.\nIf you care about overpowering, then it's the EVOO at the end you should think about. Strongest flavour when fresh, not cooked. You can't actually taste it after a decently long simmer in a soup or stew.\nWhich, flavour wise, makes cooking with EVOO pointless in many cases. Still healthier, but that's at least why you should never use your fanciest bottle to cook, but just add flavour at the end. Use cheaper EVOO for cooking, if you still want to use that and not vegetable oil or whatever."

Unfortunately, I sometimes lose track of where I've gathered this intel from and why. Please see the recipe I cobbled together and, hopefully, aid me in filling in the missing data.\n1lb. Great Northern beans, dried\n1lb. bacon, chopped OR ham hocks\n1 onion, chopped\n1 red pepper, roasted and peeled (subbed for jalapenos: don't like jalapenos)\n1/4 c. tomato paste\n1/4 c. OR 2 TBSP dark brown sugar (CAN'T REMEMBER WHY ONE WAS RECOMMENDED OVER THE OTHER)\n1/4 c. molasses OR 2-3 TBSP (DITTO)\n3-4 cups chicken or vegetable broth\n1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (I'd likely use chili powder)\n1 tsp black pepper\n2 tsp kosher salt\n1/2 tsp liquid smoke\n2 TBSP apple cider vinegar\n?? ketchup\n?? Dijon mustard OR 1 tsp dry mustard powder\nSoak beans in a glass or plastic bowl with just enough water to cover them overnight or 12 hours, TOPS.\nOver medium heat, to an oven-safe Dutch oven add bacon, onion, red pepper (instead of jalapenos) until enough fat has been rendered from the bacon to soften the onions (about 5 minutes).\nStir in tomato paste, molasses, dark brown sugar.\nPreheat oven to 250F\nDrain the beans, reserving the bean liquid.\nAdd the beans to the Dutch oven.\nPlace bean liquid in a measuring cup. Add enough broth to make the liquid come to 4 cups. Add that 4 cups of liquid to the Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat.\nStir in cayenne powder (or chili powder), black pepper and salt.\nCover the Dutch oven and bake in the preheated oven for 6-8 hours.\nIn the last hour of cooking, stir in apple cider vinegar, ketchup, and either Dijon mustard or the dry mustard powder.\nQUESTIONS:\nAt what point do I add the liquid smoke?\nWhat will be the difference in outcome if I use 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar as opposed to only 2 TBSP of it?\nWhat will be the difference in outcome if I use 1/4 cup molasses as opposed  to only 2-3 TBSP?\n6-8 hours is a pretty wide range of cook time. How will I know when I've reached \"the last hour of cooking\"?\nHow much ketchup would I add?\nHow much Dijon mustard would I add?\nThe fact that I made these additions on my notes means that something I read made me think \"yum\". I just can't remember how much or why!\nIf it helps, I like a thick but NOT dry/gloppy consistency - still a saucy-ness to them with a nice balance between tangy/sweet. Not a fan of overly sweet beans nor beans so spiced that I feel like a dragon nor so tart that my eyes water.\nThank you!",

I'm also hoping to have most things be able to be made or prepared ahead of time, so maybe 1-2 things need to go into the oven right before but that's it (some family members can be overbearing, controlling, and weirdly competitive with each other, so I don't want anybody trying to \"help\" in the kitchen the day of.

The first is to go for a Milan dish - that's my preference, as it's the most localized, and that's dope. But I'm open for expanding to the greater Lombardy region, there's a lot of recipes there as well and realistically dirtbags will find ways to get offended about all across the region, not just in Milan. I'm game for any recipe that hails from an hour of where any event will occur.\nWe are a pretty light meat household, and we have a 3 week old baby, so time is not necessarily in our favor, and I won't be able to get to the grocery store till 4PMish, so long stews are maybe out of the question (but maybe we'll make those tomorrow).\nI was thinking Risotto alla Milanese would be dope to make, especially with the snow and shit hitting us. I found\nhttps://www.yesmilano.it/en/articles/risotto-alla-milanese\nThe problem is that veal is hard to find, and more specifically veal bone marrow. Is there a good substitute for veal bone marrow? And also veal broth...I'm thinking maybe using a mushroom broth since it seems sometimes this is a mushroom dish.\nAlso, wtf the roast beef juice? Do I just get some of Boar's Heads finest and stick it in a juicer? I got one of those lemon squeezers for squeezing lemons while keeping the seeds out, that'd probably keep the meat out.\nShockingly, I can find saffron.\nAs I'm writing this, I'm realizing we have a few Asian grocery stores, and eastern European grocery stores, we might have a couple other ethnicities - if anyone has a good idea where I can find some veal. Bonus if they'd also sell all the other stuff (like the rice).\nIf anyone has another suggestion on recipes, I'm down to clown. Veal Milanese (cotoletta alla Milanese) is of interest too, but I'd probably just end up making Chicken Schnitzel...since my fiance don't like pork so I couldn't just straight copy my Bavarian homies.\nTIA",
        "top_comment": "Veal is hard to source these days as it's gone out of favor. You could substitute beef marrow if you're hell bent on following this recipe.\nI'm fairly certain the \"beef juice\" is miss translated from aju sauce, which is made from the dripping of a beef roast. In the US we call it au jus.\nPersonally, I'd shift to a recipe that uses more available ingredients.\nRisotto alla Milanese"

You can carve off a piece put it in a pan and cook it to any doneness you want.\nBut to understand what carryover cooking does and what it means, you need to buy a probe thermometer that goes into the meat and the thermostat sits outside of the oven and tells you real time what the temperature is internally. When you remove it from the oven, you put a tent of aluminum foil over it and watch the temperature continue to rise for the next 20 minutes.\nInstant read probe thermometers don't work well for large pieces of meat."

I figured I'd just have to not put any salt on the skin. It was really delicious and crispy, but I wanted it to work like in the video.\nSo for my next attempt, I didn't put any salt on the skin, and instead just put the salmon skin down in the oiled pan. It never unstuck. I did two filets at once, and they just never, ever unstuck. I finally tried pulling one up, but the skin just ripped away, and I scraped on it for like five minutes with metal utensils before it came free fully. It wasn't just stuck, it was WELDED. So for the second filet, I waited and waited and waited until it was embarrassingly overcooked and it was STILL stuck. Again I had to scrape the skin off when I finally just wanted to eat it. The skin was all shrunken and shriveled and burnt, and the flesh was overcooked. So it was done cooking and then some. What happened? Why wouldn't it release?\nI did pat the salmon dry on both sides, btw.",

I find massaging the leaves a bit leaves it softer when I make caldo verde (kale-potato-sausage soup, also means green broth) but if I\u2019m just boiling it with a chicken breast or whatever I leave the stem on. It\u2019s chewy and kinda hard yes but super healthy for you.\nIf you live in a climate that allows it, kale is pretty easy to grow. I have a crappy green thumb and even I manage to do it, so much so that I give a lot to neighbours because it\u2019s too much for me. Once it\u2019s ripened, use the fresh leaves all you can, then chop it all up and freeze it tightly in ziploc bags to freeze for the winter.\nBut yeah, if there\u2019s any Italian/portuguese grocery store near you check that out.

Flour roux will resist breaking when reheated.\nIf the cheese sauce is breaking from reheat or getting watered down from the chicken juices, sodium citrate may help keep it from breaking.\nThere is modified food starch available on Amazon, brand name \"Clear jel\". It has more thickening power than regular corn starch is far more heat stable. They make an instant version that will jel any hot or cold liquids but can clump if not careful. Its what is used in instant puddings.\nRegular clear jel has to be heated and will work better in a heated dish. Both are available on Amazon."

My question though is, are the grocery store frozen bags better because they're flash frozen, or is it pretty much the same if I just prep a bunch myself on the weekends and vacuum seal for freezing myself?\nEdit: My bad, I worded it wrong. I meant are the frozen ones better than freezing myself, NOT chopping them fresh. I always prefer to chop fresh, but I get home from work 12 hours after I leave. I'm getting older and more tired.

I do eat vegetables, like pepper, broccoli, carrots, beets and so on, and I wanted to ask for a few tips of seasonings, favorite recipes and ways to include these stuff in my overall meals!! I tend to be a pretty lazy person when it comes to cooking, mostly because I have to clean the dishes after and I'm a uni student, time is limited lol, so if you guys know any fast recipes that are tasty and include veggies, please let me know!!",

Just add it in the last minute or so of cooking when you add the cream. They'll wilt down and completely change texture. You can even chop it first into strips."

Soaking ahead of time (or a quick soak) would cut down that time slightly, but it will take more than 20 minutes. The good news is that it's a very hands off process. Soak the beans, drain them, put them in boiling unsalted water, and let it roll until they're soft."

I've seen this done in Korean food videos/restaurants, and I've also seen rice sold in a mix with bean/pulses in Asian groceries (I think the product was Taiwanese), so I know it's quite commonly done.\nMy concern is that the beans won't be completely cooked and become toxic - this happens when beans such as kidney beans are simmered too low, so their toxins get activated rather than being deactivated (when boiled at higher temps). \nIs this a risk in rice cookers? \nDo you avoid certain beans due to this risk?\nAlso I'm guessing people soak the beans, pulses and grains in water first before cooking in rice cookers? How long?",
        "top_comment": "I typically soak the kidney beans refrigerated for about a day with a little bit of salt. I rinse it, then I put it on standby.\nI then cook the rice on the rice cooker, then place the beans while the rice is in the middle of cooking. That's usually how I'd do it. Would be great with tomato paste, seasonings, and other kinds of beans.\nThere might be better methods but that's how I do it as a home cook."

Slight spillage with most of the filling still inside and great texture overall.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nRecipe:\nPhiladelphia cream cheese\nCheddar and mozzarella cheese\nSeasoning\nCut and gut jalapenos and pat dry\nFill halves with filing\nWrap with centercut bacon and secure with toothpick\nCook some.

I moved back in with my mom temporarily. my brother and his fiance moved in with us recently.\nI make food for the family often and will cook recipes with meat. I always use a lot of fresh herbs, garlic, onion and spices. However, I feel like EVERY time, they always add extra salt to my food even without tasting it. When they cook, they also heavily season the vegetables, which I do not mind. Personally, I sometimes prefer the simplicity of veggies and I actually enjoy the flavor of them so often I will not use a lot of spices for them. They still add extra salt even to the veggies.\nI am having a hard time with finding the balance because I also have a low salt tolerance. I dont think that you should taste or feel salt, it should be used to bring out the flavors. How can I find a balance so that they do not feel like they have to always add salt to my food? Or could it be that they have a higher tolerance?  My mom cannot have too much salt, my stepdad always adds hot sauce to food, and I never add extra salt to my children\u2019s food, so seeing my brother adding this extra salt now, has made me insecure in my cooking!\nTLDR: Family members have been adding salt to my meals everytime I cook, even without tasting it. Despite me adding extra seasonings and 2x  the salt that I would preferably add to meals. I am a vegetarian and my family eats meat so I am not sure if I am adding too little salt or if they have a higher tolerance. What can I do so they dont feel like having to add extra salt.",

        "top_comment": "If you had a workable dough, I don't understand how the cream would \"split\" in this scenario.\nI assume the liquid you experienced came from the ham and cheese. Some brands of cheese can be quite oily, especially those on the cheaper end of the spectrum.\nTo address your question though, yeah, use milk. There will be consistency differences as the cream is the only fat source in your dough. Biscuits like some fat to help them out, that is why you often see butter, lard, and/or milk/cream in them."

It looks like it's 2/3 regular short grain white rice and 1/3 purple short grain rice. Unfortunately, they don't have a phone number or anything (you order through the phone software) and their delivery driver is a random person that knows nothing about the food.\nI've been able to find Thai black rice in my local Asian grocery store but it's not the same texture (it's slightly stickier than the stuff from the Vietnamese place). It DOES meet the incredibly nutty aroma the Vietnamese rice has. So I'm thinking maybe they're mixing Jasmine with this black rice or something?\nALSO they add some very very basic flavoring to the rice. It's the barest hint of sweetness, acidity, coconut and something that reminds me very loosely of lemon zest.\nI haven't been able to find any specific recipes online - does anybody know if this is a traditional way of preparing rice in Vietnam or does it sound like something special the restaurant's doing?",
        "top_comment": "Purple rice the way you described sounds more like the korean prep which is very similar in mixing black rice with white rice to get that purple hue.\nThere are 3? major types of black rice... thai long grain (glutinous) rice which sounds like what you got - you find that more often in desserts across SE asia.  Chinese black/forbidden rice which is an indica rice i think and not sticky.  And then theres the Black japonica (short-grain) which i think is a hybrid and the one you're looking for.\nI havent ever seen that as a dinner rice but i also havent spent a lot of time in vietnam.  Regarding flavoring, its possible they cooked it with coconut water which is sweet, aromatic and has a tiny smidge of acidity."

        "body": "Hey everyone \u2764\ufe0f I am hosting the super bowl for about 10 people and I want to make a balanced and enjoyable spread for everyone.\nIn the group chat some people offered to bring the following appetizers and I said yes to them all because I am pretty easy going as a host and any help is appreciated always.\nPeople are bringing\n-pigs in a blanket\n-deviled eggs\n-teriyaki meatballs\n-beer\nI am making 2 mains.\n-Cajun pasta (this was recommended by like 6 people directly so I have to make it lol) I am also making homemade ciabatta loaves to go with the pasta.\n- I am unsure what to make as a second main. Chill? Taco bar? Pulled pork sandwiches? Idk I need ideas\nFor appetizers, is the 3 being brought enough? I also have chips/salsa but wondering if we need a dip. Or should I try to throw together some sort of veggie tray, meat and cheese/ charcuterie?\nShould I make a salad for freshness?\nWhat desserts would complement well? I was thinking of making some lemon cookies maybe, I also just got heart-shaped cake pans and wondering if I should make a little heart-shaped cake since Valentine\u2019s Day is coming up or if that would be off the theme?\nAs far as drinks, I have beer covered and a full liquor cabinet. I wonder if it\u2019s a better idea to make big batches of some cocktails or to just make them at a time like I usually do, I have noticed when I do that I spent most of my night making drinks.\nI also am making jello shots because I have a ton of jello about to expire in the next few months lol\nI am probably overthinking it, but it is my first time hosting anything since my husband and I got married and I really want it to go well. I love throwing any sort of party and all I want is my guest to be happy and to be way more than there needs to be.",
        "top_comment": "Wow, I don't know how many guests you will have, but this is all great, though I would strongly suggest you get help. It's a lot to do alone and you want to throw stuff out and then enjoy yourself too!  You mentioned that in terms of drinks, so what I have done in the past in made pitchers of some sort of mix which people can either drink alone as a nonalcoholic drink or put a splash of liquor in it.  I have done a Bay Breeze or if you are a New England fan, it could be a Cape Codder.  You could also forget about it and just provide beers and soft drinks as people can overdo on the liquor and it can get expensive.\nWith the pulled pork, taco bar, or chili, if you are also going to make Cajun pasta, do you have a second crockpot or some other way to keep these things warm?  Other than the pasta, all of these also typically come with several toppings, so factor in the time to make those ahead of time too.\nLast year, I made pans of brownies and then cut them into football shapes, frosted them in chocolate and then used white icing to paint in the laces.\nThis year, I am spreading French bread halves with a cheese spread and pizza sauce and then topping them with roasted vegetables.  I may put shredded mozzarella on top before toasting the bread halves, and then I'll slice them so that people can just pick up what they want.  It's good at room temperature too."

        "top_comment": "There are 2 things that cause food to go bad if not stored properly.\nThe first being bacteria, fungi and other small organisms. They feed on the food and turn it into more of them. When you eat these they will try to turn you on more of them. Obviously this is bad. Luckily, these get killed when you heat the stew up again (assuming you get it to a high enough temperature for long enough)\nThe other is harmful compounds that get created by these organisms while they feed. Like how you shit and piss, these creatures also excrete waste. And like a turd, heat alone doesn't exactly make it more healthy to eat.\nSo, heating the stew up after does make it safer but not entirely safe.\nAs for if it was stored properly: it depends on the temperature it got to before being heated up again. It either would need to have stayed quite hot the entire time or be cold like a fridge. Otherwise these organisms will find a way into the food and be able to do their thing with it, plate or not."

Nothing to write home about quality wise but considerably cheaper (and less food waste...) than buying a giant loaf at the grocery store that is already kinda stale and squished on the shelf.\nYes, I realize the \"correct\" answer is to bake my own. I've done it. I'll do a no-knead maybe 5 or 6 times a year? And a \"real\" bread... maybe twice every three years? But it always becomes a race to eat it before it gets stale and there are a LOT of sacrificial slices.

I first encountered the recipe during farmers market season, so I substituted 2 fresh hot jalepenos for the canned chipotle. I sweated the jalepenos along with the onion. Now, my version has a really nice kick on the first day. Day two it is still a bit spicy but a lot less. Day three leftovers are devoid of heat. Is this a thing about cooking with peppers that I never knew about?",

Honestly, the basic version of that sauce already tastes really good.\nFor a more natural vibe, you could add chili oil instead of sriracha, use freshly grated horseradish instead of store paste, and honey instead of sugar.

Onion, garlic, and basic seasonings keep it straightforward. The sour cream adds a little tang and helps keep the loaf moist and tender. The bacon on top adds flavor and helps keep the meatloaf from drying out as it bakes. I include cheddar cheese because it helps break up the density of the meat and adds a little extra flavor, but the loaf still works well without it.\nIngredients\n1\u00bd lb (680 g) Ground beef\n\u00bd cup (50 g) Plain breadcrumbs\n1 Large egg\n\u00bd Sweet onion, finely chopped\n2 teaspoons Garlic powder\n1 teaspoon Mustard powder\n1 teaspoon Salt\n\u00bd teaspoon Black pepper\n1\u00bd Tablespoons Worcestershire sauce\n\u00bd cup (70 g) small cheddar cubes\n3 Tablespoons (45 g) Sour cream\nRegular-cut bacon strips (not thick-cut), enough to cover the top\nMethod\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\nIn a bowl, mix the ground beef, onion, garlic powder, mustard powder, salt, and pepper together. Then add the sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, egg, cheddar cubes, and breadcrumbs, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; that can cause the meatloaf to be tough.\nShape into an even loaf and place it in a buttered loaf pan.\nLay regular-cut bacon strips across the top in a single layer, touching.\nBake uncovered for 50\u201360 minutes, or until a meat thermometer reads 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) in the center and the bacon is crisp.\nRest 10 minutes before slicing.\nNote\nIf time allows, you can cover and refrigerate the shaped loaf for a few hours or overnight. This gives the breadcrumbs time to hydrate and helps the loaf hold together better. Let it sit at room temperature while the oven preheats so it isn\u2019t going in ice-cold.\nServing suggestion\nWhile the meatloaf bakes, cook a baked potato, baked sweet potato, or roasted winter squash in the oven at the same time.",

As a student looking for close to 4K calories a day, the default options for lunch tend to be super time consuming stuff to cook, or super basic egg based dishes (which are boring to me).\nRecently been eating quite a lot of Prosciutto based sandwiches (like rocket (arugula) Parmesan, maybe pickled red onion), balsamic, olive oil. Either as quick lunches with minimal cleanup, or even as snacks.\nThe main reason I think, is I can often just pick up these ingredients, and they always get use in some form. I\u2019m a student, so can\u2019t rely on having lots of fridge space (e.g. I can\u2019t really buy and keep ingredients just for the occasional lunch dish). Also they\u2019re fairly cheap, and you can vary the sandwich a lot (Olive oil? Butter? Balsamic? All? Etc).\nFor example:\nProsciutto, I can always snack on. But I can also use it in some salads, or crisp it up, and use as an elevated topping for stuff. And it\u2019s not too expensive for what feels and tastes likes a more premium ingredient (not great value by weight, but in identity, definitely).\nRocket. Love how it can do everything from a versatile and not overpowering as a garnish to top dishes and bring freshness. But can be made into quite a nice base for salads to go with e.g. steak and chips or something.\nParmesan (or whatever Italian hard cheese). Lasts for ages in fridge, and valuable for any pasta dish, as well as in salads or tbh almost everywhere.\nThe rest are pretty core store cupboard stuff (pickled red onion slices are also my kind of default for a tangy acid brightness in salads, or to top some things).\nAnother variant for me is some tuna pasta salad. I  always keep tinned tuna+ pasta. So all I need to pick up is some feta, cherry tomato\u2019s, etc or whatever you want. Olive oil+ lemon juice and you have a solid lunch, that also doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s just cobbled together (sometimes it does ngl).\nAnd stuff like feta lasts forever, can kind of be the core of a dis (often pasta or salads). or just top avocado on toast, shakshuka, Almost any tomato based thing etc.\nDo you have other kind of default meals/snacks that you gravitate towards due to convenience. And where the ingredients don\u2019t necessarily have to be bought for that purpose.\nI haven\u2019t purposely chosen Italian/Western European cuisine, but have kinda defaulted there (feel like pasta + students is an inevitable pairing).",

I know the people of Italy have access to higher fat milks and cheeses, allowing for greater flavors than what I can access here in Canada, but I need to at least try to make this at home. \nI can make a pretty good bake or non bake regular cheesecake at home, but I NEED this beautiful light and airy cheesecake in my life again, even if it's half as good I'll be happy.\nCould any of you suggest how to create a cheesecake that had a smooth flavor, without the brightness (lemon zest?) you usually find in homemade cheesecake, it was piped onto the plate (not necessary, I'd be fine to just scoop it out of a bowl), but with a texture of almost like a moose, the opposite of a usually dense cheesecake.\nAny pointers would be great,\nThanks all.\nI've found a photo of it from a review.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XPHWBfK\n*\nUPDATE #1\n*\nOk Everyone, here is the breakdown of the ingredients I went for after reading your several helpful tips, and a few recipes for cheesecake mousse.\n[Making the whipping cream] \n- 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream.\n- 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar.\nUsing a hand mixer I wiped the whipping cream to stiff peaks, slowly adding the sugar.  Once stiff peaks formed I covered the bowl and put it in my cold garage to chill.\n[Making the cream cheese/mascarpone mix]\n- 55g of cream cheese\n- 110g of mascarpone\n- 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar\n- 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract.\nUsing a hand mixer I wiped the mascarpone and cream cheese together until it was very smooth, slowly added the sugar, then mixed in the vanilla extract.  Covering it, putting it aside at room temp.\nSo, now, after dinner (wife is plating it right now), I will softly add some whipped cream into the mascarpone/cream cheese bowl, and mix together.  I'm not going to just dump all the whipped cream into the mascarpone as I want to slowly add it, as I want to keep the mascarpone/cream cheese flavour, and not dilute it by adding more whipped cream than it needs.\nTasting the mascarpone/cream cheese mix, I honestly think I could just stop right here and be happy.  It's happening, everyone, I think we did it.\n*\nUpdate #2\n*\nAnd here we are, years in the making.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6bC1sOf\nFirst off, it was very good. I'd be happy to serve it again even if I never improved on what I ate tonight, however there was room for improvement.\nThe flavor was smooth and at an appropriate level, and my god the ROI was great, it took no time to put together and you can dish it out well after you have completed preparing it, just keep it chilled.  Recently, I've been making chocolate or vanilla souffles for dessert, but they are annoying because you need to basically cook everything right then and there, nothing can be prepared beforehand, but with this cheesecake you could make it the day before and you just need to dish it out, so I'll 100% be using this as one of my go-to desserts in the future.\nWhat I could improve on:\n- First off, I was right about not mixing all of the whipped cream into the cheesecake mix, I only used half of the whipping cream in the cream cheese/mascarpone mix, as with each scoop of whipped cream you add it was another step away from the flavor I wanted. So next time I'll probably only use 1/4 of the whipping cream I had listed in my ingredients list.\n- Next, I wish I had also chilled the cream cheese/mascarpone mix, as I had thought the chilled whipping cream was going to bring down the temp of the room temperature cream cheese/mascarpone mix, but because I used so little of the whipping cream it was a little too warm, but that was just a learning mistake. \n- Maybe slightly more vanilla extract, and I'll also try using a vanilla bean.  The level of vanilla was nice, I'm just crazy for vanilla so I'll push it a little further, or maybe not because wife said it was perfect...\n- The biggest and most difficult change I want to make however is doing what\n/u/newbies13\nsuggested and trying a No2 siphon. As while this cheesecake was great, it didn't quite have the lightness I had remembered, and I believe this user is correct in saying it was probably run through a siphon, enforcing No2 into it, creating a lovely airy bite.  I believe once I get this No2 dialed in, I will only require a slight amount of whipped cream (or maybe not at all) to slightly reduce the cheesecake mix, allowing the cheesecake mix to work better with the No2 siphon, using the No2 to create the airy texture. Again, the more whipped cream, the more you reduce the best flavor, the cheesecake, so if the No2 adds the lightness while allowing me to keep 100% (plus maybe some required gelatin) of the cheesecake flavors, then we are laughing baby.\n- Also next time I'll add a buttery Bischoff crust, I do with all my cheesecakes, but tonight was all about the cream.\nFinally, to all of you, I did not think this was going to turn into a team effort, but it really did, and wow did you all have great insight.  Not only did you all point me in the right direction, but gave me every possible suggestion on improving the thing I've been lusting over for wayyyy too long.   So thank you, really, today was fun.\nI'll keep adding updates as I change the formula, getting it closer to what I consider to be almost perfection.\nGoodnight everybody.",

Bass does better cooked a little firmer (hotter pan or longer time) than something like salmon.\nIf the texture really turns you off, you\u2019re not alone \u2014 a lot of people just don\u2019t love bass for that reason.

I set them aside on a paper towel to drain off excess liquid.\n2) Par-baked the crust - admittedly, I not only wanted to give the crust a chance to crisp, but I had made a decorative edge that I wanted to preserve. I did a blind bake with pie weight to start, then pulled the crust from the oven, did additional docking on the bottom, and baked it a bit more without filling.\n3) Scrambled egg base - I placed some of the onion and mushroom filling directly into the bottom of the par-baked crust, but wanted a way to reduce cooking time, so the crust could remain crisp rather than soak up the wet eggs. I decided to pan-scramble eggs with about 1/3 of the mushroom and onions, then spread those on top of the veggie layer, so the scramble reached about 3/4 to the top of the crust, with space between.\nI then added shaved parmesean along with beaten eggs and milk to fill in the gaps. Then it went back in the oven to finish baking.\nThe results were lovely. The fillings were well dustributed, the texture was fluffy but firm, and the crust was flaky. Even though it took extra steps, I'd do this method again.\nMushroom & Onion Quiche",

        "top_comment": "You're fine.\nAdd the flour before the liquid next time.  I usually add the flour and cook it a bit right before adding beef stock.  Make sure there's enough fat.  Depending on the recipe it'll be runny at first but as it simmers down it should thicken up.\nCarne guisada is one of my favorite meals."

        "top_comment": "Any recipe can be taken from \"bland\" to flavorful with the proper use of seasonings, spices and salt. Learning how to cook is learning how to use seasonings to get to your own desired tastes.\nHow many times in a recipe review do you see the commenter reply that the recipe was too salty? Or not salty enough? Most recipes are minimally seasoned to appeal to the masses.\nUnless it's baking where many precise measurements may be required for the desired results...most other recipes are generally used as a guide. Rarely do I ever use the quantities of seasonings and salt that are listed in recipes. I use the recipe to tell me WHAT to use and HOW to prepare it.\nThe longer you cook the more able you are to judge how much seasoning a dish should have to appeal to your own tastes. You will be able to see that it is 1 teaspoon of salt for a certain amount of food just isn't enough for your tastes so instead you add 1 Tablespoon. It takes time...and trial and error.\nIf you are preparing a recipe that doesn't have enough uumph...adjust the seasonings. Taste as you cook. Just about any recipe can be made to be more flavorful to you."

The meal includes:\nChicken thighs. Pressure cooked in low sodium chicken broth with tomato bouillon\nVeggies. Mix of lima beans, carrots, green beans, and corn\nPotatoes. Mashed with butter\nI season with light salt and pepper in everything\nI mix the mashed potatoes and veggies to allow me to eat the veggies. Yes, I'm a kid in an adult body still.\nThe problem I'm having is sauce. I currently use BBQ sauce or ketchup for everything, don't judge, but I'm thinking a sauce will be better for taste\nI do freeze my meals and defrost everyday in case I don't eat them one day, I don't waste\nI'm thinking brown or country gravy but I've read that brown gravy seperates and country gravy has milk and shouldn't be frozen. All gravy packets I've looked at have some form of milk in them\nSo what can I make/buy to use as a gravy?\nI know roux will be mentioned and I'm not cooking savy as mentioned before. Plus my attention span isn't the best. Think squirrel from up and that's what's I do, I'd rather be able to just add ingredients and simmer if have too, store bought would be best for me honestly but don't think that's possible\nSorry for the long essay but trying to be as thorough as possible",
        "top_comment": "If you don't want to learn to make it from scratch coming you could just buy some powder mix and make yourself a gravy pretty easily, I think it would be fine to freeze honestly."

        "top_comment": "I can't recommend brands.\nPoint I wanna make is that while \"better\" olive oil definitely does make a difference, there's so many different kinds. Specialized EVOO sellers will often treat them like wine, and make different scales for different characteristics: this one is 6/10 fruity, 8/10 herbal, 7/10 astringent, and so on.\nThere are some objective (or near-objective) health truths in that a higher concentration of antixiodants is better, but we're talking about tasty food, not medicine.\nPersonally, I like golden-coloured oils, often from southern Spain. They make some in southern France too. Very fruity, little bitterness. This is not at all the same as some oil which isn't bitter, just cause it's not extra-virgin. Different applications too: a typical Greek, deep green, fairly bitter, olive oil, is fantastic in or over your usual suspects: tzatziki, feta salad etc.. But if I wanted a gazpacho, basically a refreshing summer soup with very few calories, then I'd want that Andalusian, fruity, golden, olive oil."

Cut it up or shred however you like, then put in the pan with a little water and heat up over low heat with a lid on.  The water and lid sort of steam them so they don\u2019t dry out."
