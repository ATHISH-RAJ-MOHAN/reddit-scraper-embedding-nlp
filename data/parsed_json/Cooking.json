I need to use everything I\u2019m cooking with for each singular time, save for spices and whatnot, but all ingredients have to be exactly enough for the amount I\u2019m cooking and the rest is thrown out because it\u2019ll use up too much space.

But I\ndo\nhave a small bottle of orange extract I picked up for baking a couple months ago.\nI want to think this would provide the flavor, and it's probably more concentrated than anything else, so I wouldn't need a lot? But that's where I start seeing issues - The recipes I've seen usually call for around a cup or more of these ingredients, depending which is being used. Swapping that for a bit of extract would definitely change the consistency of the sauce, and the amount produced.\nIf the extract covers the flavor profile, what would need to be changed or added to maintain other aspects of the sauce? I'm not too experienced in making sauces from scratch, otherwise I'd probably just start experimenting with it.\nI'm confident I have every other ingredient I'd need. I'm aware that the extract might produce a more artificial flavor than other sources of orange, I'm not really concerned with it. I'm just wondering if this is a substitution that can be done?"

Unfortunately I strongly dislike some basic elements: salad dressing, vinegar, mayo.\nAs an example, I had a dish of chicken with roasted brussel sprouts and quinoa the other night. It taste good but was a little dry as left overs. Or cold examples I'd want something for would be a green salad or dense bean \"salad\".\nDoes anyone have a sauce or dressing recipes without the mayo and vinegar? Or has anyone found a good substitute for one of these elements? Thank you for the help!"

I\u2019d also really like to make sushi. In general, I love Asian food.\nIdeally I want something that\u2019s as low-effort as possible.\nWhen I make rice at the moment, I usually mix it with vegetables that I pan-fry, then add tomato sauce, soy sauce, or a creamy sauce.\nFrom a quick Google search, I keep seeing Zojirushi and Tiger.\nAre those really the gold standard and worth investing in right away, or is that overkill for someone who\u2019s still a bit of a beginner in the kitchen?\nThey also seem harder to get in Germany (my country), and I\u2019m wondering if as a beginner I\u2019d even notice the differences.\nI\u2019m willing to spend more if it genuinely adds value.

My husband suggested home-made kebabs or gyros, but again, we have no idea what spices there will be to use!\nOf course we can do very simple things, like bangers and mash with the potatoes we will already be buying for the pie, or a fry up (but we already do that a lot at home), but we would like something more involved aside from cutting up potatoes and frying some sausages.

I always felt bad throwing out shiitake stems when cooking, since it seemed a tad wasteful even though they\u2019re generally too tough to eat. One night, I took a big pile of stems I had left over while the rest of dinner cooked and sliced them lengthwise into halves or quarters. I tossed them into my dehydrator for a few hours, then ran them through my (cleaned) coffee grinder.\nWhat resulted was the fluffiest powder I\u2019ve ever seen, almost a like powdered sugar. It\u2019s also one of the most versatile and delicious things I have in my seasoning cabinet now. Whenever I make a sauce, stew, gravy, or similar, I add a tablespoon or so of this stuff. It\u2019s an amazing thickener, and a huge hit of umami. The only downside is that if you don\u2019t dump it in a bit quick, the hot air rising from the pan can sometimes carry some of the mushroom powder away!"

        "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhLLHTsE7Pg\nDon't get your bloomers in a bunch over stereotypes, remember this is 1964 and the target audience is traditional housewives raising their baby boomer children on the man's salary.\nThe agenda is to popularize Chinese-influenced food and show off how easy it is to integrate a \"rare combination of foods that are so readily available for Chinese cookery\" into the American menu, with La Choy brand ready to meet the market demand with its line of canned products. Was this subversion by the \"Red Chinese\" cleverly disguised as marketing? lol ... but TikTok was to debut 52 years later ...\nThe video reassuringly stresses the modernity and sanitation of the production process. This was a concern when considering \"foreign\" or \"exotic\" foods.\nThe chef character cites the yield at the start of each of his demonstrated recipes. Put yourself in the housewife's position: \"four to six servings\" ... why, the recipe would be perfect for your nuclear family!\nShowcasing La Choy brand \"Chinese\" food thoroughly Americanized so as to be intriguing yet accessible, the recipes are simple and straightforward, eminently doable in any American kitchen. Other than soy sauce and bean sprouts, nothing is particularly \"foreign\" or \"exotic\"; the chef even calls his wok a \"Chinese cooking pan\".\nNice cameo by old-school Pyrex measuring pitcher!\n\"Thirty minutes? My customers are going through the roof right now! In thirty minutes they'll be in orbit!\" The waiter character uses the word \"orbit\", because of course he does. It was '64, we were in the middle of a Cold War and a Space Race; everybody knew the scientific technical term \"orbit\".\nI appreciate the chef explaining that chop suey is not Chinese at all.\nIncidentally I also noticed, because this is\n/r/Cooking\nafter all, that neither the chef character, nor the \"girl\" character who demonstrates more recipes in the second half, whatever role she plays in the restaurant, doesn't use excessive heat, the bane of so many amateur home cooks, even in his \"Chinese cooking pan\".\nWhen the waiter character objects the recipes look like they can't be done in a typical American kitchen, the chef holds up one of those \"handy sealed containers\", cans, obviously, but if you look closely it's a special can. It's actually two cans taped together, something La Choy pioneered for its canned Chow Mein product. The meat and sauce were in the smaller can on top and the vegetables in the larger on the bottom. Was this borne of production logistics, or was it a Bernays-style \"add an egg\" ploy to make the American housewife feel she's actually cooking rather than just opening a can?\nOh look, La Choy even has a recipe and suggestion book! Where can I get one?\nThe remaining demonstrated recipes are done in a modern American kitchen. No \"Chinese cooking pans\".\nYMMV but that bacon-wrapped water-chestnut, pineapple, and chicken liver plate would be perfect for Bridge Night. I need to get multi-colored toothpicks.\nThe girl character sings the virtues of \"Chinese\" food as low-calorie (yes they had diet fads aplenty even then) and high in protein, but also as a \"meat-stretcher\", not some device that you'd prank the FNG with but something to add meat to to make a fuller meal, like Hamburger Helper was to do in the early 1970s.\nSpeaking of dietary fads, keep an eye out for sugar in the recipes. After Ike had his heart attack in '55 there was a massive push to vilify fat and lionize sugar, as Adam Conover would be happy to ruin for you.\nAdditionally, mentioning she can get all the provisions she needs for dinner in one place, even one shelf, surely takes the drudgery out of shopping for your family. No need to make separate stops at the butcher and greengrocer (which was a thing in the '60s before the all-in-one \"Super-Market\" became the norm).\nThe background music switches from traditional Chinese-style music to flutey jazz for the rest of the video. This is the hardcore-sell part of the video where the girl demonstrates some serious Chinese-influenced recipes that the American housewife can realistically use.\nThe \"sumptuous\" Mandarin salad looks positively awful, ngl. And mayonnaise? Always with the mayonnaise. Nice cameo by a yellow Pyrex glass mixing bowl, though. Those go for a pretty penny at mid-century antique malls.\nCheck out the Hall Rose Parade pitcher to the left of the coffee station!\nScrambled eggs \"\nOrientale\n\"? French-Asian fusion egg foo young? What would Jacques Pepin think?\nIdk about boiling chicken for what basically amounts to a chicken stew, but ... Hello Revere Copper Clad saucepan!\nCute ending, waiter wants to take girl on a dinner date, but with Women's Lib just around the corner she insists on making it herself for them at her place. Chinese pizza? I'm intrigued...\nSomeone once said that immigrants conquer us with their food.\nBut my favorites pieces of trivia about La Choy brand specifically are (1) La Choy was started by Ilhan New and Wally Smith, and (2) The three owners of La Choy, all Americans, appeared on\nWhat's My Line\nand nobody guessed they made Chinese food!"

I've prepared sandwiches and made things like scrambled eggs, but never cooked a full meal like starting with the raw meat and cooking it.\nMy mother has always cooked for me. I live with her but she's old now and she experiences hair loss. I've been having a hard time eating what she makes because I almost always find hair in the food. She seems to have a hard time accepting that.\nAnyway, we concluded today that she would no longer cook for me and I will start to cook for myself. She's not going to be teaching me how. She's not good at teaching and is very impatient and has an anger problem and it's physically taxing for her to stand behind me to show me things.\nI don't even know where to get started. I could just buy several loafs of bread to go through in a week and eat non-stop sandwiches, but I'd rather not have to live like that.\nWhat are the simple and basic meals I can prepare for myself regularly to rotate in the week to keep me steady until I can learn more later?\nPlease just provide me with whatever info you think helps.\nThanks for your help!\nEDIT: To give you guys an idea of what I like to eat since a lot of you are asking -\nI do eat meat but I am moving away from red meat and cheeses. I've considered becoming a vegetarian for health reasons, particularly high cholesterol. I may just stick to chicken and fish because I think veggie only would be highly restrictive... let's just say 80% veggie and 20% meat. I don't eat pork meat.\nI do enjoy eating tacos a lot. I never really seem to get sick of them. So I'll most likely eat variations of tacos each week.\nI do like pastas when done right.\nI enjoy a lot of Asian cuisine as well so sushi.\nI do like to eat things with potatoes. I love a baked potato with sour cream as well.\nI don't really care for rice.\nHope that gives an idea.\nEDIT 2: Thank you all immensely for all these super helpful responses. A lot of you are really kind. I have read every single one and will be using it to help me prepare meals!"

One thing I thought of though that I am less practiced at is homemade pasta. Would introducing garlic powder to the pasta itself cause integrity issues? Would it even make a meaningful difference flavor wise?\nI'm looking for ideas, brainstorming, recipes, history; anything. Bonus points if the concept can produce a nice pink color to give an extra nod to the seasoning. I love this woman with all my heart, and times have been a bit tough lately with my depression.

Would better spatulas and knives actually improve my mediocre cooking skills or is that wishful thinking? My family doesn't complain about my meals so maybe my tools are adequate for our needs already. The cost of replacing everything properly would be significant, easily five hundred dollars for basics which seems excessive. That money could go toward groceries for months instead of tools that might not make any noticeable difference. My cheap knives are dull but they still cut eventually with enough effort and pressure applied. My spatulas bend but they still flip pancakes even if it's awkward and frustrating sometimes. Is my frustration worth hundreds of dollars or should I just accept cooking isn't my passion and adequate tools are sufficient? My sister upgraded her kitchen and raves about the difference constantly saying she actually enjoys cooking now. Maybe there's something to this that I'm dismissing too quickly without properly considering the benefits. Quality tools supposedly last decades while I replace my cheap ones annually which adds up over time financially. I found professional kitchen tools on Alibaba at reasonable prices but I'm still debating if this is justifiable."

Anyway, one of the items is a full and very large cabbage head.\nWe are having company this weekend and I was wondering if we can use it as part of a corned beef and cabbage meal. In the past, I neutralized the vinegar before using it for a soup. And that worked, with some fiddling. But it this case, the corned beef actually cooks in pickling spices, so I was wondering if we could just heat the cabbage separately and serve it.\nI have no idea what I am doing. So any help would greatly be appreciated (besides telling my husband to NEVER accept a bounty like this again \u2014 we just eat so differently than this friend does and it feels wasteful).\nAny other ideas of what to do with several quarts of pickled vegetables would also be welcome!"

Every other oil I've tried has burned the outside breading of the fish before the inside could get done enough, so I'm opting to baking the fish the rest of the way. I use thermometers but maybe I also need a new deep fryer... anyways has anyone cooked fish in tallow or lard, and if so how did you like it? Was it too greasy? Tips?\nAlso any tips about how to cook the inside of the fish better is appreciated :("

I'm an experienced cook, though this is my first foray into homemade pasta.\nFollowing a few recipes I saw, I made a well with three cups (spooned into a one cup measuring cup) all-purpose flour and four eggs. I stopped at three since it overflowed the well and mixed the flour in. It didn't become dough at all, but basically egg drop soup on my counter. I had to add more and more flour to simply make the dough. I finally got it to form a dough using all four eggs and probably another cup of flour, and let it rest. No matter what I did, it fell apart in the pasta roller. Added water, even a drop of oil, and it still fell apart, even when the consistency seemed right. I finally gave up and cut some strands just to try it, put it in salted water, boiled for two minutes, and....nothing. It dissolved into the water entirely, not a single strand was left, simply dough water.\nWhat went wrong? Could the flour be bad?"

I\u2019m worried they won\u2019t be anything like she remembers though!
