        "body": "Hi! So, I tried finding information about this online, but nothing seemed to come up.\nCan I use orange extract to make orange sauce?\nI don't have orange juice, marmalade, fresh oranges, or any other source of the flavor that I've found listed in recipes. But I\ndo\nhave a small bottle of orange extract I picked up for baking a couple months ago.\nI want to think this would provide the flavor, and it's probably more concentrated than anything else, so I wouldn't need a lot? But that's where I start seeing issues - The recipes I've seen usually call for around a cup or more of these ingredients, depending which is being used. Swapping that for a bit of extract would definitely change the consistency of the sauce, and the amount produced.\nIf the extract covers the flavor profile, what would need to be changed or added to maintain other aspects of the sauce? I'm not too experienced in making sauces from scratch, otherwise I'd probably just start experimenting with it.\nI'm confident I have every other ingredient I'd need. I'm aware that the extract might produce a more artificial flavor than other sources of orange, I'm not really concerned with it. I'm just wondering if this is a substitution that can be done?"

        "body": "Hi :)\nI\u2019ve been getting more and more into cooking lately. For years I was mostly the \u201cheat up ready-made meals\u201d type.\nI\u2019d love a rice cooker because I really hate cooking rice, but I\u2019d like to eat it more often. Right now my go-to side for most meals is usually just pasta.\nIf a device could take that off my hands and maybe also steam vegetables, or even cook potatoes, that would be amazing. I\u2019d also really like to make sushi. In general, I love Asian food.\nIdeally I want something that\u2019s as low-effort as possible.\nWhen I make rice at the moment, I usually mix it with vegetables that I pan-fry, then add tomato sauce, soy sauce, or a creamy sauce.\nFrom a quick Google search, I keep seeing Zojirushi and Tiger.\nAre those really the gold standard and worth investing in right away, or is that overkill for someone who\u2019s still a bit of a beginner in the kitchen?\nThey also seem harder to get in Germany (my country), and I\u2019m wondering if as a beginner I\u2019d even notice the differences.\nI\u2019m willing to spend more if it genuinely adds value. Main thing is I want to cook a wider variety of meals :)\nWould love to hear your thoughts."

We will be getting our shopping done on the way there on the last leg of our journey into the countryside on a train, so we won't be able to have a look around to decide what we have to work with beforehand. And we also don't want to spend the money on buying a bunch of these things when we will only be using small amounts of and won't be able to bring everything back, as we are traveling by train with a couple backpacks.\nSo far we are thinking sheperds/cottage pie, because tomato paste and worcester sauce is easy to carry with us (or home with us) and the rest is easy ingredients that won't go to waste, but I am blanking on other ideas. My husband suggested home-made kebabs or gyros, but again, we have no idea what spices there will be to use!\nOf course we can do very simple things, like bangers and mash with the potatoes we will already be buying for the pie, or a fry up (but we already do that a lot at home), but we would like something more involved aside from cutting up potatoes and frying some sausages. But again, without too many ingredients!\nThank you for an insight or ideas you have!"

The coconut cream gets mixed with lime juice, chilled, and then drizzled(?) dolloped(?) on top of the sweet potatoes.

One night, I took a big pile of stems I had left over while the rest of dinner cooked and sliced them lengthwise into halves or quarters. I tossed them into my dehydrator for a few hours, then ran them through my (cleaned) coffee grinder.\nWhat resulted was the fluffiest powder I\u2019ve ever seen, almost a like powdered sugar. It\u2019s also one of the most versatile and delicious things I have in my seasoning cabinet now. Whenever I make a sauce, stew, gravy, or similar, I add a tablespoon or so of this stuff. It\u2019s an amazing thickener, and a huge hit of umami. The only downside is that if you don\u2019t dump it in a bit quick, the hot air rising from the pan can sometimes carry some of the mushroom powder away!"

She seems to have a hard time accepting that.\nAnyway, we concluded today that she would no longer cook for me and I will start to cook for myself. She's not going to be teaching me how. She's not good at teaching and is very impatient and has an anger problem and it's physically taxing for her to stand behind me to show me things.\nI don't even know where to get started. I could just buy several loafs of bread to go through in a week and eat non-stop sandwiches, but I'd rather not have to live like that.\nWhat are the simple and basic meals I can prepare for myself regularly to rotate in the week to keep me steady until I can learn more later?\nPlease just provide me with whatever info you think helps.\nThanks for your help!\nEDIT: To give you guys an idea of what I like to eat since a lot of you are asking -\nI do eat meat but I am moving away from red meat and cheeses. I've considered becoming a vegetarian for health reasons, particularly high cholesterol. I may just stick to chicken and fish because I think veggie only would be highly restrictive... let's just say 80% veggie and 20% meat. I don't eat pork meat.\nI do enjoy eating tacos a lot. I never really seem to get sick of them. So I'll most likely eat variations of tacos each week.\nI do like pastas when done right.\nI enjoy a lot of Asian cuisine as well so sushi.\nI do like to eat things with potatoes. I love a baked potato with sour cream as well.\nI don't really care for rice.\nHope that gives an idea.\nEDIT 2: Thank you all immensely for all these super helpful responses. A lot of you are really kind. I have read every single one and will be using it to help me prepare meals!"

        "body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhLLHTsE7Pg\nDon't get your bloomers in a bunch over stereotypes, remember this is 1964 and the target audience is traditional housewives raising their baby boomer children on the man's salary.\nThe agenda is to popularize Chinese-influenced food and show off how easy it is to integrate a \"rare combination of foods that are so readily available for Chinese cookery\" into the American menu, with La Choy brand ready to meet the market demand with its line of canned products. Was this subversion by the \"Red Chinese\" cleverly disguised as marketing? lol ... but TikTok was to debut 52 years later ...\nThe video reassuringly stresses the modernity and sanitation of the production process. This was a concern when considering \"foreign\" or \"exotic\" foods.\nThe chef character cites the yield at the start of each of his demonstrated recipes. Put yourself in the housewife's position: \"four to six servings\" ... why, the recipe would be perfect for your nuclear family!\nShowcasing La Choy brand \"Chinese\" food thoroughly Americanized so as to be intriguing yet accessible, the recipes are simple and straightforward, eminently doable in any American kitchen. Other than soy sauce and bean sprouts, nothing is particularly \"foreign\" or \"exotic\"; the chef even calls his wok a \"Chinese cooking pan\".\nNice cameo by old-school Pyrex measuring pitcher!\n\"Thirty minutes? My customers are going through the roof right now! In thirty minutes they'll be in orbit!\" The waiter character uses the word \"orbit\", because of course he does. It was '64, we were in the middle of a Cold War and a Space Race; everybody knew the scientific technical term \"orbit\".\nI appreciate the chef explaining that chop suey is not Chinese at all.\nIncidentally I also noticed, because this is\n/r/Cooking\nafter all, that neither the chef character, nor the \"girl\" character who demonstrates more recipes in the second half, whatever role she plays in the restaurant, doesn't use excessive heat, the bane of so many amateur home cooks, even in his \"Chinese cooking pan\".\nWhen the waiter character objects the recipes look like they can't be done in a typical American kitchen, the chef holds up one of those \"handy sealed containers\", cans, obviously, but if you look closely it's a special can. It's actually two cans taped together, something La Choy pioneered for its canned Chow Mein product. The meat and sauce were in the smaller can on top and the vegetables in the larger on the bottom. Was this borne of production logistics, or was it a Bernays-style \"add an egg\" ploy to make the American housewife feel she's actually cooking rather than just opening a can?\nOh look, La Choy even has a recipe and suggestion book! Where can I get one?\nThe remaining demonstrated recipes are done in a modern American kitchen. No \"Chinese cooking pans\".\nYMMV but that bacon-wrapped water-chestnut, pineapple, and chicken liver plate would be perfect for Bridge Night. I need to get multi-colored toothpicks.\nThe girl character sings the virtues of \"Chinese\" food as low-calorie (yes they had diet fads aplenty even then) and high in protein, but also as a \"meat-stretcher\", not some device that you'd prank the FNG with but something to add meat to to make a fuller meal, like Hamburger Helper was to do in the early 1970s.\nSpeaking of dietary fads, keep an eye out for sugar in the recipes. After Ike had his heart attack in '55 there was a massive push to vilify fat and lionize sugar, as Adam Conover would be happy to ruin for you.\nAdditionally, mentioning she can get all the provisions she needs for dinner in one place, even one shelf, surely takes the drudgery out of shopping for your family. No need to make separate stops at the butcher and greengrocer (which was a thing in the '60s before the all-in-one \"Super-Market\" became the norm).\nThe background music switches from traditional Chinese-style music to flutey jazz for the rest of the video. This is the hardcore-sell part of the video where the girl demonstrates some serious Chinese-influenced recipes that the American housewife can realistically use.\nThe \"sumptuous\" Mandarin salad looks positively awful, ngl. And mayonnaise? Always with the mayonnaise. Nice cameo by a yellow Pyrex glass mixing bowl, though. Those go for a pretty penny at mid-century antique malls.\nCheck out the Hall Rose Parade pitcher to the left of the coffee station!\nScrambled eggs \"\nOrientale\n\"? French-Asian fusion egg foo young? What would Jacques Pepin think?\nIdk about boiling chicken for what basically amounts to a chicken stew, but ... Hello Revere Copper Clad saucepan!\nCute ending, waiter wants to take girl on a dinner date, but with Women's Lib just around the corner she insists on making it herself for them at her place. Chinese pizza? I'm intrigued...\nSomeone once said that immigrants conquer us with their food.\nBut my favorites pieces of trivia about La Choy brand specifically are (1) La Choy was started by Ilhan New and Wally Smith, and (2) The three owners of La Choy, all Americans, appeared on\nWhat's My Line\nand nobody guessed they made Chinese food!"

Would it even make a meaningful difference flavor wise?\nI'm looking for ideas, brainstorming, recipes, history; anything.

        "body": "Is investing hundreds in quality utensils cook really necessary or just pretentious for a home cook? I've cooked with cheap dollar store tools my entire adult life and survived without any major disasters or injuries. My friend who's a chef insists proper tools transform cooking but she cooks professionally so of course she would say that naturally. Would better spatulas and knives actually improve my mediocre cooking skills or is that wishful thinking? My family doesn't complain about my meals so maybe my tools are adequate for our needs already. The cost of replacing everything properly would be significant, easily five hundred dollars for basics which seems excessive. That money could go toward groceries for months instead of tools that might not make any noticeable difference. My cheap knives are dull but they still cut eventually with enough effort and pressure applied. My spatulas bend but they still flip pancakes even if it's awkward and frustrating sometimes. Is my frustration worth hundreds of dollars or should I just accept cooking isn't my passion and adequate tools are sufficient? My sister upgraded her kitchen and raves about the difference constantly saying she actually enjoys cooking now. Maybe there's something to this that I'm dismissing too quickly without properly considering the benefits. Quality tools supposedly last decades while I replace my cheap ones annually which adds up over time financially. I found professional kitchen tools on Alibaba at reasonable prices but I'm still debating if this is justifiable."

I stopped at three since it overflowed the well and mixed the flour in. It didn't become dough at all, but basically egg drop soup on my counter. I had to add more and more flour to simply make the dough. I finally got it to form a dough using all four eggs and probably another cup of flour, and let it rest. No matter what I did, it fell apart in the pasta roller. Added water, even a drop of oil, and it still fell apart, even when the consistency seemed right. I finally gave up and cut some strands just to try it, put it in salted water, boiled for two minutes, and....nothing. It dissolved into the water entirely, not a single strand was left, simply dough water.\nWhat went wrong? Could the flour be bad?"

If not clear then I will go with this one, seems solid. Also, any tips would be cool since I have never used stainless steel pans before. Like I've read someone said you should not use EVOO for cooking a steak and use regular olive oil because it may burn or something. Is this true?\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cookware/comments/1fkkaj6/comment/lo1kwlp/\nThe way I understand this conversation is that regular olive oil is ok but virgin or extra virgin would mean it may burn? I use EVOO for everything.\nAnother guy said to not use the water trick where you put dropplets and if they dance that that means you can start cooking, because he said by that time it's already too hot..

The stalks are light green beneath the buds, turning darker green lower down.\nI would swear it's been dipped in food colouring or something - although the dark green buds are genuinely \"good ones.\"\nEdit: wow, thank you for all the fast comments! OK, I'll stop buying it from those guys and watch out for a better one. My country doesn't inspect fresh veg too much, and farmers are poor - I was worried about a more problematic reason.\nIt tastes fine, too - not perfect, but 8/10.\nIs this a new preservation technique?

        "body": "Looking for a recipe / dish name! In the mid-90s, my Korean housemate used to make these things like pancakes but smaller, with a bunch of sliced veg in them. I remember that the batter was loose, the veg was uncooked until it went into the pan, and her food was eye-wateringly hot. (I'm from a very-spicy-food country and she just broke me.) I think there was a mixed sauce they were served with, to dip into.\nI know some of her food used tiny little dried fish that set my mouth on fire, but I can't remember if that was part of this. I don't think they were in the pancakes, but it might help to clarify region?\nI've googled over the years and tried to recreate it, but no luck so far!"

To my surprise, one good stir at the very beginning has been enough to prevent my noodles from coagulating in every pasta dish I\u2019ve made in the past few months, no oil required. The money I\u2019ll save!\nHere\u2019s what doesn\u2019t make sense to me:\nWhen pasta is dry or fully cooked, it isn\u2019t sticky at all. Put it in boiling water for ten seconds and your pasta has amassed into a single solid chunk. Normally when I think about fusing two non-sticky objects together, I imagine heating something to liquid state and then allowing it to cool on the desired point of adhesion, such as in welding. Obviously the pasta isn\u2019t being liquefied, but perhaps the softening + expansion of the noodles + reductions in surface area where the noodles touch create cool spots where the noodles can harden and fuse to each other? But even if that were true, it wouldn\u2019t explain why it only happens at the very beginning of the cooking process. Is it a coating on the pasta, maybe?\nTldr; dry and cooked pasta not sticky, why pasta stick?"

Instead of sweetbreads, I wanted to prepare a protein main that we have less frequently at home, so duck seemed like a good idea as I\u2019ve only made it a couple of times.\nThere\u2019s also an element of visual similarity. In the movie, the dish has a single piece of protein resting on some tentacles (which I will use green beans or mini asparagus), and a thick orange sauce is poured over it.\nThe idea I have: precook the duck breast (sear + oven) just before the movie. It would be resting for 30 mins on the counter, and since I\u2019m entering the kitchen at 30 min, I would put the duck in the oven (50-60deg Celsius) for the next 17-20 mins till the special order scene comes on. The sauce will be made and held in the warmer the whole time till required\nThe purpose of the question is to get opinions on how doable my duck idea is, if it\u2019s likey to go terribly I will stick to slow cook beef. It is less ideal because it doesn\u2019t resemble to dish in the movie, and also I frequently do beef rib stews, so not as much \u201cwow\u201d factor, but I\u2019m sure he will enjoy it just fine."

        "body": "My mom bought costco raw white shrimp preserved in a small % of saline/salt. I peeled the shrimp and kept the shell and head and tails. Wondering what I could do with it especially to bring to office for lunch?\nI had a potato stew that I made many times before with costco rotisserie chicken stock/broth. Removing the meat and boiling the bones to get the broth/stock.\ndiced carrots, celery, onions, potatoes, corn, pea, hot or smoked sausage.\nI thought about utilizing most if it not all the shrimp shells and just boiling it in water to create the shrimp broth. Maybe saving some to create a shrimp oil. Create the potato stew with shrimp stock instead this time and drizzle the shrimp oil.\nI would serve the stew with a protein (fish or shrimp or some seafood) and a bowl of rice\nAny other ideas that I could make for work lunch?"

Other recipes suggested a lower temp like 275\u00b0, 300\u00b0.

It's been 2 solid hours since I put the foil-covered ham in the oven. It's sitting flat side down with some pineapple juice for moisture. Yet the meat is only 90 degrees at the hottest point. And some places measure 85\u00b0. That seems way off.\nWe cook routinely - entrees, cakes, cookies, roasted vegetables - and haven't had any problem with the oven temperature otherwise.

Used better than bouillon in the water. 1 min plus I forgot about it so did a quick release after 6 min or so warming.\nBuff sauce: 3 TBL melted butter, 3 TBL Frank\u2019s Red Sauce, dash Worcestershire, dash hot sauce.\nChopped it and tossed it in (estimates) 2 TBL avocado oil, 1 tsp each smoked paprika, powdered garlic, then a little fresh cracked garlic. Browned on the stove for 8 min or so before adding buff sauce until it was all soaked in and caramelized.\nMade up a salad w ranch dressing, combined in a wrap w the tempeh.\nSurprisingly yummy.

Do not pour broth over the chicken.\nRoast at 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) for about 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes, or until the thickest part of the breast reaches 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C).\nHalfway through roasting, rotate the pan (not the chicken) to help it brown evenly.\nIf the pan starts to dry out, add more broth to keep the drippings from burning. Do not baste.\nRest the chicken\nRemove\u00a0from the oven and let the chicken rest in the pan for 10\u201320 minutes.\nMake sure the legs and sides release easily before lifting the chicken out.\nTransfer the chicken to a platter and let it rest while you make the gravy.\nMake the homemade gravy (in the roasting pan)\nCarefully remove any large solids from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving the browned bits in the pan.\nAdd about \u00be cup (180 ml) unsalted chicken broth to the pan.\nPlace the roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat and whisk to loosen all the flavorful bits from the bottom.\nBring to a light bubble.\nThicken\nMake a cornstarch slurry with cornstarch and cold water (or broth).\nWhile whisking, drizzle the slurry into the bubbling broth/drippings until the gravy thickens to your preferred consistency. Add small amounts at a time to prevent over-thickening. If the gravy becomes too thick, thin it with a little broth.\nTurn off the heat and taste. Adjust with Salt and Pepper and seasoning as needed.\nAdd the resting juices\nBefore carving, carefully tilt the chicken and pour any juices from the platter back into the gravy. Stir to combine.\nServe\nRemove the onion and celery from the cavity before carving.\nCarve and serve with plenty of homemade gravy.\nNotes\nThis method is designed for crispy skin and flavorful drippings, so keep broth in the pan, not on the chicken.\nResting is part of the recipe. It keeps the chicken juicy and makes the gravy better."

I think it's pretty dang good, but every once in a while I consider adding other seasonings. Not replacing what I have, just adding on to it to see what happens. Experiment.\nI've tried garlic (granulated, as I'm too lazy to try to do it \"right\"), but didn't feel like it added anything. It didn't take away from the flavor, it just didn't improve it at all. I also tried ground nutmeg once and really didn't like it. Right now I'm considering either ground mustard, celery salt, or maybe sage or thyme?? I'm not sure about those two though. Dunno how they'd pair with dill. What would you add?\nRough recipe:\n- Shrimp\n- Pasta (medium shells or cavatappi work best imo)\n- Flour & Butter for a roux\n- Chicken stock (see below)\n- Salt & white pepper to taste\n- Heavy cream\n- Lemon juice\n- Parmesan (not the stuff in the can)\n- Dill\nPrepare your shrimp. I prefer to buy the frozen, pre-copkwd, peeled & deveined because again, lazy. So for me this involves thawing and removing the tails.\nCook your pasta. I prefer either medium shells or cavatappi with this.\nAdd your shrimp to your pasta for however long whatever shrimp you bought takes to cook.\nDrain the pasta.\nMeanwhile, make the sauce:\nMake a roux, then add chicken stock (you could use white wine or veggie stock, I just use chicken because it's almost always in my pantry). At this point, I add salt and white pepper, plus whatever addon I'm experimenting with (if I am).\nAdd a bit of heavy cream. I usually go around the pan 1.5 times.\nOnce that thickens, add lemon juice.\nAdd Parmesan. I prefer shaved over grated. Add as much as your heart desires or your guts allow. (if your sauce is too thick, add some pasta water)\nOnce the parm is incorporated, add your pasta & shrimp. Mix slightly\nTop with a GENEROUS amount of dill. Add some extra Parmesan if it makes you happy.\nMix well. Allow to sit for a few minutes.\nEat."

Eight portions to cook are overwhelming me much more than five, however. Any must-try suggestions?  No smoker, but do have sous vide, slow cooker, and pressure cooker. Has anyone tried using brisket in a grinder to make ground beef?\nOpen to suggestions, want to try a steak-temp extra long SV in addition to a faux-BQ temp one, and a pot roast-esque stew, but that still leaves five more portions. Even with freezing most of the portions, would like to get more adventurous than the same 2-3 things multiple times. Would like to try brisket pho, any good recipes would be appreciated\nThank you!!!"

I know it's not the same as a grill with smoke and all that but I want it to have a good taste. But I also want it to be easier and cook more evenly than stove top would. I think that quick cooking would also be a good benefit as he works full time.\nCan someone who knows a thing or two kind of break down the difference between these two? Pros / Cons?

(30cm?)\n- Bacon rolls (they\u2019re filled with goat cheese) or for small cuts of meat. Smaller one here (20-24cm?)\nSometimes my girlfriend likes to use a large pan to cook minced meat + bell peppers + peeled tomatoes, \u2026 I am however thinking of telling her to use the large pot in cast iron for this.\nWe\u2019ve got our eye on stainless steel pans from Demeyere but we\u2019re definitely open for suggestions if there are other ones you recommend. We have an oven dish and cast iron pot from Le Creuset; which we also like a lot.\nThe pans we had were from Greenpan and were non-stick (which\u2026 seemed to be bullshit since it always stuck).\nThanks in advance for your advice!\nEdit: we\u2019ll be cooking on induction!

Which is actually why I picked up a ton of beans on my grocery order, so I can test them myself, see what ones I like, what differences are, etc etc.\nBut, I still can't get over figuring out what I'm supposed to use them in.

I somehow manage to not royally screw up anything I cook and everything typically turns out pretty ok but I definitely need help to improve.\nI cooked the last ones in a non stick pan over medium high heat, I only salted the steaks and added a bit of butter to the pan before putting them in.

The total weight is 2.5 kg, but the fillets are compressed into one solid square block about 5 cm thick, with no clear separation lines.\nI was recommended to thaw the frozen block in refrigerator and than separate the meat into 100 g or 150 g portions for meal prep and than re-freeze them again.\nOr perhaps to cut the frozen block into 150g portions with some sort of stainless steel serrated knife for frozen meat?\nIt's not a must to to preserve whole fillets, more importantly to portion it by weight.\nI have a more than one frozen block of chicken breasts. This is how I did with the first block:\nI thawed the block only in the refrigerator. It was wrapped in plastic wrap, placed on a plate, and kept in a closed lower fridge drawer. Total thawing time was about 30 hours. The meat stayed cold, but the center was still partially frozen and very firm.\nBecause the fillet boundaries were not visible, I did not try to separate individual fillets. Instead, I cut the block by weight. I sliced it into slabs and then into smaller portions.\nFor cutting, I used a regular kitchen knife. It did not work well on the firm center.\nAfter portioning, I packed the portions separately, removed air, and re-froze them again after about half an hour.\nMy main questions are:\n-Is it possible or a good choice to cut and frozen block into portions with some sort of knife for frozen meat so I could avoid the thawing and re-freezing process altogether?\n-Is thawing raw chicken in the fridge for ~30 hours and then re-freezing it acceptable if it stayed cold the entire time?\n-Is cutting a dense, partially frozen block by weight (not along fillet lines) a reasonable approach in terms of quality loss?\n-Is using a serrated kitchen knife acceptable here, or does it significantly damage texture compared to normal thawing and cutting?\n-I\u2019m mainly concerned about food safety and whether any quality loss from this approach is meaningful for everyday chicken breast cooking.\nThank you!"

It wasn't miso, it just said fermented bean paste. I'm new to fermenting but it seems like this is definitely a necessary step for it to not to go bad quickly.\nI've also used beans in sweet dishes before. That made me think; what if I just had a big jar of unseasoned blended bean paste in my fridge, to use as I see fit? That way I can just put a tablespoon in whatever I'm making such as oatmeal, sandwiches, smoothies, etc. and add flavor per dish. But from what google tells me, a paste like this would only last a couple of days.\nI guess my question boils down to: is there a way for me to have a neutral flavor bean paste to keep in the fridge, that doesn't spoil in a few days? I could freeze it if there's no other way, but it would be more convenient if it doesn't need to thaw first.\nCurious to hear your thoughts!"

Clearly, it\u2019s just a tad bit underbaked. I feel like the bun part I can do. I will be using the Tangzhong method and I will be putting milk powder in the buns as well. The part that I\u2019m struggling with, is the milk cream filling to be clear, this is not a bread that has the typical whipped cream filling. It\u2019s a milk cream. I feel like it\u2019s got some type of specific texture that I haven\u2019t been able to find in other places, almost cream cheese texture, but it\u2019s not cream cheese tasting, and not exactly as firm as it either. I\u2019m confused on whether to use condensed milk, milk powder, whole milk, whipping cream, cream cheese, mascarpone. Honestly, it could be just milk, which has been heated with cornstarch to produce that texture that I\u2019m talking about. I know the taste needs milk powder. So, any tips and tricks for helping me re-create this bread perfectly it would be phenomenal, thank you so much!!!"

I hate to use this as an example but the closest thing I could think of is when I was a kid, my family would take food to a family in need and their home smelled awful, like a combination of old food and a bathroom that had never been cleaned.\nI thought maybe the food had just gone bad, but something about it made me suspicious that either the ham hocks or the salt pork was to blame.\nLater, I made a gumbo, which I do about every two months. This time I opted for pricier andouille sausage, and I noticed when I cut into it that it was very fatty. \u201cGreat,\u201d I thought, but once the gumbo was simmering I got a very slight whiff of that disgusting smell, even as it cooked. (It was so faint I wasn\u2019t sure I had smelled it or if it was just in my head. I tried to get my wife to smell it but she didn\u2019t notice).\nThe gumbo tasted fine after the simmer, and perfect the next day.

When I make it you can see the particles of cilantro and potentially jalapeno in it. it's a dark green color instead of the light green uniform that I see in restaurants. Maybe I'm using too many stems? I certainly process all the vegetables before I put any mayo or olive oil in there. And I have a very powerful Ninja smoothie.\nAny answers to some or all of my questions would be greatly appreciated!"

        "body": "About six years ago, well before the world changed with COVID, I began to lose my ability to smell and taste. I can still sense the basics like sweet, sour, salty, spicy, or bitter, but it\u2019s just a faint signal, a sense rather than a full experience. After seeing a number of doctors who couldn't provide a medical solution, I\u2019ve simply learned to accept it as my reality. This loss isn't just about missing out on flavor; it\u2019s a safety issue. My wife has come home to the smell of gas because I\u2019ve accidentally bumped a stove knob without a flame catching. I\u2019ve since installed several gas sensors throughout the house.\nDespite this, I haven't given up on the joy of cooking or eating. I\u2019ve just changed the rules of the game.\nMy culinary exploration now centers mostly on texture and structure of the food I eat. Crunch, crispness, and firmness are what define a successful dish in my kitchen. When I cook pasta, it must have enough of an al dente body to roll firmly around my mouth so I can identify the specific shape and origin through feel alone. Vegetables are treated with the same rigor, they must maintain their own defined structure after cooking because I simply cannot tolerate mushiness. Every bite needs to provide some sort of tactile feedback to make up for what I cannot taste. Meats are prepared with a specific focus on firmness. A properly prepared medium-rare steak is of sensory importance. The contrast between the seared exterior and the yielding center \"roars\" in my mouth in a way that goes beyond mere taste. Breads have become equally vital to my daily experience. I find genuine satisfaction in the crannies of a toasted English muffin, the dense elasticity of a bagel, or the pillowy softness of a fresh-baked loaf. At the same time, I\u2019ve learned to navigate the savory \"umami,\" I can sense, though I have to be careful when cooking for others. What feels like a necessary boost of sensation to me can easily overpower a guest\u2019s palate.\nThere is so much more I\u2019m discovering every day by treating my palate to new textures and senses."

So I will often eye stuff and taste as I go and things work great. But I kept tasting this sauce (a new spoon every time because I'm not a savage), and it just keeps tasting ... off. Definitely bitter/too strong or something. Maybe too salty? I tried to sweeten with mirin and even honey but no improvement. My working theory: wayyyyyy too much garlic/ginger. I sometimes go overboard with this and I don't measure this part usually. Could also have burned the aromatics slightly but I don't think so because the stuff didn't brown. Third theory is the oil I used - sunflower seed oil that was slightly cloudy - was off?\nBut now I have gallons of this stuff and 24 hours to fix it. Should I:\nStart over -its fast and easy to make and I can afford it.\nTry to \"thin out\" the garlic and ginger in the recipe by adding more of the mirin, soy and sake solution.\nAdd more sugar/mirin/honey only.\nIt doesn't taste BAD... Just not...great. and it's usually great!\nThanks in advance for any advice you can give."

For several reasons, i wasn't able to cook them until today. But when i opened the container, it was a slight bit foamy and i'm not Sure whether they smelled a tad bit sour. I cooked them regardless and the turned out alright, but they don't Taste as good and flavourful as usual. \nAfter looking at several posts and websites,  i'm still unsure about whether it's safe to eat the chickpeas or not.

I bought various brands of \u201cthe right stuff\u201d - San Marzano, from Italy, etc., including what I would think would be the least likely to taste sweet- whole peeled SM tomatoes, from Italy, from the Italian brand here in the US everyone seems to love, Cento.\nI open the can and what do I taste? Ketchup!!!! of course I might be exaggerating a little bit but still, it was far, far sweeter than what I wanted.\nWhat am I missing here?? I would so love the option to have something bright and acidic out of a can and be able to very mildly sweeten the final sauce with a tiny bit of sugar, if I want to. But this doesn\u2019t seem to be an option right now, and I would really like to avoid having to process my own tomatoes.\nThanks!"

THEN WHY DID WE ALL AGREE TO MAKE IT THIS WAY\nthe only way to get acceptable farfalle is to fish out each piece individually and evaluate it, which defeats the purpose of a quick weeknight dinner. i might as well be hand-feeding each noodle like a baby bird\ntier list (tomato canned guy, 2025)\nS tier (box time within 45 sec): rotini, mafalda, spaghetti\nA tier (off by ~1 min): most shapes honestly\nB tier (off by 1:30-2 min): fusilli, rigatoni, fettuccine, gemelli\nC tier (off by 2+ min): ziti, large shells                                                                   F tier: farfalle (structurally unsound, should be banned)\ntldr;\nsubtract 1-2 minutes from whatever the box says\nstart testing 2-3 minutes early\ndon't trust big pasta\navoid farfalle unless you have time to babysit each individual bow tie\n+ some of you may ask about fresh pasta. fresh pasta cooks in like 2-3 minutes and you can actually tell when it's done because it floats. dried pasta is where the lies live\n+ a few of you might mention altitude affects boiling point and therefore cook time. this is true. i'm at ~650 ft so basically negligible. if you're in denver add a minute or two. if you're in la paz you have bigger problems than pasta timing\n+ YES i tested farfalle from multiple brands. YES they all sucked. no i will not be accepting farfalle apologists. you're defending a shape that can't decide if it wants to be cooked or not\nEDIT: yall holy shit i never expected this to go viral lmao"

Burnt, completely black, but the \"cheese pull\" is nice. I used Cheddar and our local semi-hard cheese.\nMy second attempt - no butter, but added oil generously on the pan; 30 seconds from each side on low heat, then covered with a lid. Bread is dry and crispy, cheese didn't even melt.\nIs there some sacred knowledge on how to make a good grilled cheese? I've seen many videos on YouTube, and they all go like \"1-2-3 - ready\" without specifying many things, making it seem easy when it's not. Which type of bread is better? Is shredded cheese better than slices, even though it's inconvenient? Should I cover bread with butter from both sides? Maybe butter isn't needed at all? Should you lower the heat? What about the spices? If even 30 seconds on low heat is \"too much\" for bread but not enough for cheese, what am I supposed to do?"

It doesn\u2019t have to be the world\u2019s best tasting cookie, it just needs to hit the spot.\nI\u2019d love a recipe that\u2019s easy to remember (simple ratios or easy to remember gram proportions). And a cooking method that uses as few dishes as possible.  I\u2019ve gotten surprisingly close placing some dough on parchment and using the air fryer which is super convenient.\nAny ideas? Thanks in advance!\nEDIT: making a premade batch and freezing it is a great idea, but I\u2019d ending up eating cookies every night!"

The problem I ran into today was that the meat was not reaching internal temperature and still showed signs of blood when poked. it's an induction stove and was set on medium. I had to bring everything to the point of burning, and wound up. actually burning my droppings to get the meat cooked.\nI know that temperature being too high can cause this, so perhaps my stove medium setting is too high. what I don't know, is the difference in oils. All I had this time around was olive oil and I have not had issues with it in the past for different applications.\ncan anyone give me any guidance as to things to try and look out for in the future when I try this again next week? covering the pan definitely Cooks things faster, as everyone knows, but then you can't watch what you're doing and it is not something I'm typically going to do with cast iron."

Should I cut the time in half? Use a meat thermometer?

This will probably use around 8 gallons for these three, but we're stumped on what else we could make.\nWe plan to make more cheese than whats needed for the bread, as well as double the amount of condensed milk to save, and a lot of ice cream (since it'll be for 30+ people, staff, AND different kinds) but we're still going to have at least 15 gallons if we double/triple stuff.\nAny and all recommendations are welcome and much appreciated!\nEdit:\nSome people mentioned freezing the milk, but unfortunately that is not an option for us. Others have mentioned taking the milk to all kinds of shelters, food banks, and even other facilities. The latter we likely won't get permission for, as the closest facility (owned by the same company) is about an hour away, and it's unlikely that anyone would be willing to make the trip (we also need permission from the administrator and possibly hr). As for the former, while I would like to go this route and donate the milk, as previously stated, we would need permission, and I think it's highly unlikely that they would allow it, based off of previous experiences.\nThank you all for the suggestions!

Flour and milk also thickens when cooled.\nThat said, here\u2019s how. \ufffc\nFIRST Turn your oven on before you start the gravy to the temperature you need for making biscuits.\nI\u2019m not gonna tell you how to make your biscuits. That\u2019s for another time. I make my own biscuits or I used Pillsberry biscuits in a roll. They work fine.\nMake your gravy \ufffc\ufffc\nBrown crumbled sausage. Don\u2019t leave it in small chunks. Crumble it. You can do that in a couple ways. One is to just go chop chop chop chop chop chop chop with two spatulas as it cooks. The other way is to brown your sausage first and then let it cool in the refrigerator and then it will crumble easily in your fingers. You\u2019d have to do that even before you warm up your oven for biscuits\n\ufffc2. Once your crumbled sausage is heated to a light sizzle, \ufffcdrop in a generous pat of butter to your liking. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir it in until it is melted. Thus: roux\nAdd a small amount of flour like a level tablespoon. Stir it  around until  it is absorbed and let it cook that way for a minute or two stirring constantly to cook the taste of flour out of it.\n\ufffc Add a splash of milk to the pan and stir that in until you\u2019ve created a paste. \ufffcLet that cook for almost a minute.\nPut in approximately two heaping tablespoons of flour, adding more or less depending on how much gravy you wish to make. Gently stir that until you have gravy that\u2019s an acceptable consistency then add a little more milk to that so it\u2019s a little bit loose and thin  Let it simmer for about two minutes.\nRemove it from the heat and walk away. Go sit down somewhere and play on your phone. Maybe text your grandmother. Or better yet use that time to bake your biscuits. That should only take you about eight minutes maybe 12. \ufffcLet your gravy sit until it is cold and then a few more minutes after that. Now when you stick your wooden spoon into it you\u2019ll notice that it is a lot thicker than it was when it was loose and bubbling.\nPut the pan back on a gentle burner and pour a bit more milk on top and stir it in as it heats back up to a bubble, adding splashes of milk as necessary while you stir.\nIf you do that right, you\u2019re gonna have hot steamy white milk gravy that is not too thick, not too thin and completely full of crumbled sausage.\n8\ufffc. Personally, I do not add anything else to my gravy, except the sausage salt and pepper. I don\u2019t put in garlic powder or onion powder or any other herbs or spices. It just takes away from the delicious flavor of sausage, milk gravy. But you do you\nThank you for not asking \ufffc\ufffc"

Sear or no sear, it can't get crispy.\nSo what do I do with it? The recipe I'm following says to rub the skin with salt and baking powder now, then brush with achiote oil before roasting. Should I still do that with the fat cap?\nIf I don't have skin, should I just pressure cook it? I was going to roast it for the crispiness, but if there's no possibility of crispiness I'd rather save the time and trouble and do it in the instant pot, then shred and crisp in the oven like carnitas.\nThanks in advance for your help and please don't yell at me for this insult to pernil. Or do, I'm fine.\nETA: Forgot to include pic, apparently can't add it now, oops."

Well, they turned out smooth, light, fluffy, and the exact potatoes of my dreams. It took literally less than 1 minute to turn a couple large spuds into 6 cups of mashed potatoes. Sure, cleaning a food processor is more work and more annoying than clean up would be for some other methods (although I'm guessing it's similar for a food mill), but the actual \"mashing\" took zero elbow grease and almost no time.\nA crucial note is that I used the fine grating disc, NOT THE BLADES. Once you feed the cooked potato into the processor, the \"grated\" potato falls into the basin, where it is not touched by anything again until you transfer it to a dish. The original idea came from when I had previously looked for creative alternatives to a ricer or mill and saw someone suggest using a microplane. I tried it once, and it worked great, just took a lot of time and an immense amount of effort. The food processor *with the grating disc* seemed like a potential way of doing the same thing, just automated. In practice, I think it probably didn't work too dissimilarly from a food mill, just where the grater itself is what spun instead of something on top of it, and where the spinning was operated by electricity instead of your arm.\nAnyways, long story short, I would highly recommend this method, especially for anyone that has any disability that affects grip or hand/wrist/arm mobility or anyone that simply hates the strenuousness of mashing a moderate to large quantity of potatoes."

Stuff like kimchi jigae, soondubu, that glass noodle thing, and korean pancake. Since I'm unemployed I started to try and copy him by following recipes online.\nMy impression of korean food is that its spicy and somewhat pungent due to the use of kimchi and other seasoned vegetables. What I did not expect is that the main 'spice blend' of these soups is three heaping spoonfuls of red pepper flakes. I knew that korean food had some spice in it but it tickles me that at the end of making soondubu jigae, the recipe just says 'aight man now throw two fistfuls of chili flakes into that shit' and it somehow turns out well\nThe korean red pepper is very mild and kind of sweet, and I like how it adds this red color to a dish warning you that it's hot, but it's not too hot. That being said the quantities of red pepper flakes I've been using lately have been abnormal, I bought a kilogram of the stuff and im halfway through it after a week. Same with kimchi.\nAnyways korean food is honestly the bomb and I think everyone needs to give it a shot at cooking some of their favorite dishes. It's a bonus that the food is, apparently, pretty healthy -- Soondubu jigae is literally just some meat, vegetabless, and broth. It's so filling that you could even skip the rice.\ntl;dr throw two fistfuls of red pepper in there and call it a day"

        "body": "Demoli Stewed Fish is a specialty dish of Heilongjiang. \"Demoli\" is a small fishing village by the Songhua River in Fangzheng County, Heilongjiang Province. The word \"Demoli\" is a transliteration of the Manchu language.\nDemoli village is very small. Since the village is located north of the Songhua River, the villagers here mainly rely on fishing for their livelihood. In the early 1980s, an elderly couple in the village opened a small restaurant by the roadside to entertain passers-by stopping to rest and eat. They stewed local live carp (grass carp, crucian carp, or catfish can also be used) together with tofu and wide starch noodles. The taste was delicious without losing the boldness of Manchuria cuisine, and more and more people came to eat, resulting in the business becoming increasingly prosperous.\nLater, the recipe for this dish spread like wildfire, and its reputation grew larger and larger. People from Harbin would often drive long distances, undeterred by the journey, specifically to Demoli to eat the local stewed fish. The fish used for Demoli Stewed Fish are all fresh live fish, only then can one fully enjoy the tenderness and deliciousness of the fish meat.\nThere are several indispensable conditions for Demoli Stewed Fish. First is fresh fish. The fish used is mostly carp or \"grass root\" (grass carp). The indispensable auxiliary ingredients for stewing the fish are brine tofu and starch noodles. It is rumored that the secret weapon of Demoli Stewed Fish is \"Maoba\". Stewed fish with Maoba added has a special flavor. The scientific name of Maoba is Agastache rugosa (wrinkled giant hyssop), which can be seen everywhere in the fields of Heilongjiang. When stewing fish, after the fish is in the pot, go to the vegetable garden to snap off a branch of Maoba and put it in the pot; the stewed fish will be incomparably delicious.\nIngredients Ingredients: One grass carp, black carp, or carp; one piece of brine tofu; a handful of starch noodles; Chinese cabbage; several slices of pork belly; some hazel mushrooms or shiitake mushrooms; one to two potatoes. Accessories: Two green chili peppers; small dried red chili peppers (must have, can put less if afraid of spiciness); one green onion; one piece of ginger; half a head of garlic. Seasoning: Salt, cooking wine, sugar, soy sauce, Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, cinnamon. Note: Legend has it that the seasonings for stewing fish also include Maoba (Huoxiang) and mountain pepper (Schisandra chinensis vine).\nPreparation Method\nFrying Wash the fish, score it, drain the water thoroughly, and fry it in oil or over high heat for three or four minutes.\nPreparing the Soup Adjust the amount of salt according to your own taste; cut the green onion into sections, do not chop it finely, as this can increase the aesthetic beauty of the whole dish; slice the ginger and peel the garlic. Put all the accessories into a mixing bowl and mix well. At this time, wash the hazel mushrooms and soak them in water. Cut the potatoes into chunks for later use.\nStewing the Fish After frying the fish, pour out the excess oil, pour the prepared soup base over the fish, and add the pork belly; add boiling water, the amount of water should cover the body of the fish but be lower than the edge of the large spoon, and stew over high heat; three to five minutes after the water boils, turn to low heat and stew for 20 minutes. (Note: The amount of water should not be too little. First, because the stewing time is long, and second, starch noodles will be added later, and the starch noodles absorb water.)\nAdding Ingredients After the fish has been stewing in the pot for about 25 minutes, add the starch noodles, potatoes, and hazel mushrooms. Do not let the starch noodles stick closely to the bottom of the pot to avoid sticking. After 10 minutes, add the tofu cut into large slices and the Chinese cabbage (the cabbage can be put in as whole leaves). After five or six minutes, turn off the heat and remove from the pot. Be sure to use a slightly larger basin to serve it, so that it is atmospheric enough to eat."

Season the chicken with \u00bd teaspoon of salt and pepper.\nWorking in 2 batches if needed, place the chicken in the pan, skin side down. Sear until golden on both sides (about 8-10 minutes total), then remove the chicken. Remove all but two tablespoons of the bacon/chicken oil from the pan - reserving the oil to use later in the recipe.\nAdd the sliced onion and carrots to the pan and let them cook until the onion is golden brown, about 7-8 minutes. Add the garlic to the pan and let it cook for 1 minute.\n1 medium onion, 4 medium carrots, 4 cloves garlic\nPush the vegetables to the side of the pan and add the tomato paste.

I don't remember the color, but I'm leaning towards it being red vs yellow. There may have also been additional fruit in the sauce.\n\u2022It was stuffed with dried fruits and nuts. I don't remember the stuffing having rice, but it's possible.\nAs I'm typing this, it's starting to feel like a fever dream and I admit that it is\npossible\nthat the chicken was not stuffed and the fruit and nuts were just incorporated into the sauce...

The soup I am using is gelatinous bone broth so it would, in theory, re-coagulate once they've cooled in the refrigerator.\nI am leaning towards completely cooking them and letting them cool and covered in the fridge.

Great Northern beans, dried\n1lb. bacon, chopped OR ham hocks\n1 onion, chopped\n1 red pepper, roasted and peeled (subbed for jalapenos: don't like jalapenos)\n1/4 c. tomato paste\n1/4 c. OR 2 TBSP dark brown sugar (CAN'T REMEMBER WHY ONE WAS RECOMMENDED OVER THE OTHER)\n1/4 c. molasses OR 2-3 TBSP (DITTO)\n3-4 cups chicken or vegetable broth\n1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (I'd likely use chili powder)\n1 tsp black pepper\n2 tsp kosher salt\n1/2 tsp liquid smoke\n2 TBSP apple cider vinegar\n?? ketchup\n?? Dijon mustard OR 1 tsp dry mustard powder\nSoak beans in a glass or plastic bowl with just enough water to cover them overnight or 12 hours, TOPS.\nOver medium heat, to an oven-safe Dutch oven add bacon, onion, red pepper (instead of jalapenos) until enough fat has been rendered from the bacon to soften the onions (about 5 minutes).\nStir in tomato paste, molasses, dark brown sugar.\nPreheat oven to 250F\nDrain the beans, reserving the bean liquid.\nAdd the beans to the Dutch oven.\nPlace bean liquid in a measuring cup. Add enough broth to make the liquid come to 4 cups. Add that 4 cups of liquid to the Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over high heat.\nStir in cayenne powder (or chili powder), black pepper and salt.\nCover the Dutch oven and bake in the preheated oven for 6-8 hours.\nIn the last hour of cooking, stir in apple cider vinegar, ketchup, and either Dijon mustard or the dry mustard powder.\nQUESTIONS:\nAt what point do I add the liquid smoke?\nWhat will be the difference in outcome if I use 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar as opposed to only 2 TBSP of it?\nWhat will be the difference in outcome if I use 1/4 cup molasses as opposed  to only 2-3 TBSP?\n6-8 hours is a pretty wide range of cook time. How will I know when I've reached \"the last hour of cooking\"?\nHow much ketchup would I add?\nHow much Dijon mustard would I add?\nThe fact that I made these additions on my notes means that something I read made me think \"yum\". I just can't remember how much or why!\nIf it helps, I like a thick but NOT dry/gloppy consistency - still a saucy-ness to them with a nice balance between tangy/sweet.

Please comment any recipe or ideas for how I can recreate this.\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/203858336@N08/55080507940/in/dateposted-public/lightbox/"

Two people have very limited mobility so they might have to sit and have other people get their food for them.\nThere are a lot of great ideas out there for appetizer style dinners, but here's the kicker: everything has to be gluten-free, nut-free, and shellfish-free. I'm also hoping to have most things be able to be made or prepared ahead of time, so maybe 1-2 things need to go into the oven right before but that's it (some family members can be overbearing, controlling, and weirdly competitive with each other, so I don't want anybody trying to \"help\" in the kitchen the day of. Think of your favourite aunties judging each other on the thickness of their pie crusts).\nAny suggestions (food and hosting related) would be welcome!!"

The first is to go for a Milan dish - that's my preference, as it's the most localized, and that's dope. But I'm open for expanding to the greater Lombardy region, there's a lot of recipes there as well and realistically dirtbags will find ways to get offended about all across the region, not just in Milan. I'm game for any recipe that hails from an hour of where any event will occur.\nWe are a pretty light meat household, and we have a 3 week old baby, so time is not necessarily in our favor, and I won't be able to get to the grocery store till 4PMish, so long stews are maybe out of the question (but maybe we'll make those tomorrow).\nI was thinking Risotto alla Milanese would be dope to make, especially with the snow and shit hitting us. I found\nhttps://www.yesmilano.it/en/articles/risotto-alla-milanese\nThe problem is that veal is hard to find, and more specifically veal bone marrow. Is there a good substitute for veal bone marrow? And also veal broth...I'm thinking maybe using a mushroom broth since it seems sometimes this is a mushroom dish.\nAlso, wtf the roast beef juice? Do I just get some of Boar's Heads finest and stick it in a juicer? I got one of those lemon squeezers for squeezing lemons while keeping the seeds out, that'd probably keep the meat out.\nShockingly, I can find saffron.\nAs I'm writing this, I'm realizing we have a few Asian grocery stores, and eastern European grocery stores, we might have a couple other ethnicities - if anyone has a good idea where I can find some veal. Bonus if they'd also sell all the other stuff (like the rice).\nIf anyone has another suggestion on recipes, I'm down to clown. Veal Milanese (cotoletta alla Milanese) is of interest too, but I'd probably just end up making Chicken Schnitzel...since my fiance don't like pork so I couldn't just straight copy my Bavarian homies.\nTIA"

In the video, he seasons both sides of the salmon with kosher salt. On my first attempts, I did that, but the salmon actually didn't stick to the pan at all. I figured I'd just have to not put any salt on the skin. It was really delicious and crispy, but I wanted it to work like in the video.\nSo for my next attempt, I didn't put any salt on the skin, and instead just put the salmon skin down in the oiled pan. It never unstuck. I did two filets at once, and they just never, ever unstuck. I finally tried pulling one up, but the skin just ripped away, and I scraped on it for like five minutes with metal utensils before it came free fully. It wasn't just stuck, it was WELDED. So for the second filet, I waited and waited and waited until it was embarrassingly overcooked and it was STILL stuck. Again I had to scrape the skin off when I finally just wanted to eat it. The skin was all shrunken and shriveled and burnt, and the flesh was overcooked. So it was done cooking and then some. What happened? Why wouldn't it release?\nI did pat the salmon dry on both sides, btw."

I have a very small kitchen and don't have a dishwasher, so I like to cook things that don't require too many utensils (extra pots, bowls, baking sheets, etc.).\nLet me give you some examples to illustrate what I mean: I often cook risotto, which is tasty but only requires a pan. I also like making soups (which I discovered on Reddit) and I've tried making spinach curry. If I have to cook something simple but that requires multiple large utensils (like pasta carbonara), I'm not comfortable. However, I'm running out of ideas, so I'd like to ask for some suggestions on recipes that require only a pan. I have no intolerances and am open to recipes from any culture. Thank you very much."

That article came out in the year 2000, and the health benefits of gelatin and collagen found in homemade stock have been known for decades. But over the past 5 - 10 years, with the mainstream consumers suddenly becoming aware of the benefits, the term \u201cbone broth\u201d was developed to market the product. This term came about because grocery stores were already selling \u201cstock,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t really stock like you get when you make it at home with bones. But when real stock made from bones and containing gelatin came into the market, they couldn\u2019t just call it \u201cstock.\u201d So to avoid the confusion and make it more marketable, they called it \u201cbone broth.\u201d So now, the word \u201cstock\u201d just doesn\u2019t carry the same meaning in most people\u2019s minds.

Looks like I can just thaw the day before and use it! Then got some pepperoni slices, basil leaves, low moisture mozzerella and a small 14oz can of crushed tomatoes (which ill add oregano, basil, salt, sugar, and olive oil).\nI know how to build the pizza, I am just unsure on how much of the dough ball to use (ie all of it or some?), how long and how hot, and if I prebake the dough a bit first?\nWhen I look up recipes related to the pan, Breville has its own recipe (\nhttps://www.breville.com/inspiration/en-us/recipes/ovens-air-fryers-microwaves/essential-pan-pizza-dough\n) and I don't know if its dumb of me to add up the water + bread flour weight to get the weight of the dough ball (which means my 16oz one will be slightly smaller).\nThis recipe utilizes the pan but their pizza oven which would not line up with my times/temps (\nhttps://www.breville.com/inspiration/en-us/recipes/ovens-air-fryers-microwaves/pan-pizza\n).\nI was thinking so far:\nThaw Pizza Dough 24-36hrs in fridge as my fridge is cold\nOnce thawed, roll it out into a circle then place into an olive oil drizzled pizza pan. Preheat my Breville Smart Oven (Cuz its just 1 pizza, itll preheat quickly and it has a convenction setting where as my oven does not) to as high as it will go (500-550F).\nPrep pizza sauce (not cooking it), thin layer on top, mozorella cheese, then pepperoni.\nBake for unsure amount of minutes (ill keep an eye on it constantly after 5 minutes of cooking) and then pull out and let it sit in the pan for a couple minutes before I cut into it.\nHope my worries make sense and thank you guys for the input!"

Yes im the one who cooks but im trying to teach him the right and wrongs of cooking.\nEdit to add: i know cooking in the oven makes it dry and i need to pound it out but due to current situation we have to use the oven for right now"

Looking at the ingredients, they seem similar. The paella base has saffron, but I add that when cooking anyways.\nDoes anyone know the difference between these products? Yes, I understand the paella base I have is for arroz negro and has cuttlefish ink in it. But let\u2019s pretend it was the standard seafood paella base.

My last trip to the spice store I left with fenugreek leaves, amchoor, ajwain, asafo-hing, and a couple blends. And that doesn't even cover everything that I will need to buy in total.\nThis spice emporium has everything, but they sell them all in plastic vacuum packs. I try to save small glass jars to repurpose and reuse, but I'm running out. I also have a couple plastic containers that I saved from this banchan shop. If I roll up the packs, I could potentially fit 2-3 spices in each of the plastic containers, but I'm worried about the smells bleeding into each other.\nI have a pretty full spice cabinet already, and these new additions are things I'm trying out. I don't know if I'll continue stocking them in the future, so I don't want to buy dedicated jars for them yet. Anyone that's been in a similar boat, what are your spice storing solutions?"

Like when do you bake it, when do you fry it a little, when do you deep fry it, when do you want it crispy, when do you not.\nI would be grateful if you can give me some tips and also some favourite recipes of yours."

The plain creamy cheese combined with stabilizers is very useful in certain recipes. But other times it's added for creaminess and really shouldn't be there, like chicken casserole. Cream cheese in a recipe is a red flag - might be OK but requires careful consideration.\nI'm sure I have others when I think about it.\nNot foods I dislike (I'm not big on pickled things and don't like pickled cucumbers for example) but things you see in a recipe and you're like \"...ehh not sure this cook knows what they're doing.\"\nFor the purposes of this post I'm excluding the really obvious stuff where the person clearly doesn't know anything about cooking.

I always use a lot of fresh herbs, garlic, onion and spices. However, I feel like EVERY time, they always add extra salt to my food even without tasting it. When they cook, they also heavily season the vegetables, which I do not mind.

They still add extra salt even to the veggies.\nI am having a hard time with finding the balance because I also have a low salt tolerance. I dont think that you should taste or feel salt, it should be used to bring out the flavors. How can I find a balance so that they do not feel like they have to always add salt to my food? Or could it be that they have a higher tolerance?  My mom cannot have too much salt, my stepdad always adds hot sauce to food, and I never add extra salt to my children\u2019s food, so seeing my brother adding this extra salt now, has made me insecure in my cooking!\nTLDR: Family members have been adding salt to my meals everytime I cook, even without tasting it. Despite me adding extra seasonings and 2x  the salt that I would preferably add to meals. I am a vegetarian and my family eats meat so I am not sure if I am adding too little salt or if they have a higher tolerance. What can I do so they dont feel like having to add extra salt."

I realized as I put it in the oven. My husband encouraged me to finish baking them and that he would eat them.

It looks like it's 2/3 regular short grain white rice and 1/3 purple short grain rice. Unfortunately, they don't have a phone number or anything (you order through the phone software) and their delivery driver is a random person that knows nothing about the food.\nI've been able to find Thai black rice in my local Asian grocery store but it's not the same texture (it's slightly stickier than the stuff from the Vietnamese place). It DOES meet the incredibly nutty aroma the Vietnamese rice has. So I'm thinking maybe they're mixing Jasmine with this black rice or something?\nALSO they add some very very basic flavoring to the rice. It's the barest hint of sweetness, acidity, coconut and something that reminds me very loosely of lemon zest.\nI haven't been able to find any specific recipes online - does anybody know if this is a traditional way of preparing rice in Vietnam or does it sound like something special the restaurant's doing?"

Make a 1-2 pound loaf once a week or so. Nothing to write home about quality wise but considerably cheaper (and less food waste...) than buying a giant loaf at the grocery store that is already kinda stale and squished on the shelf.\nYes, I realize the \"correct\" answer is to bake my own. I've done it. I'll do a no-knead maybe 5 or 6 times a year? And a \"real\" bread... maybe twice every three years? But it always becomes a race to eat it before it gets stale and there are a LOT of sacrificial slices. And no, a stand mixer is not a good purchase since they are massive and that will never leave my basement.\nBut I also realize these are also of the era of the panini press every household had but never used.\nSo... thoughts?"

It needs to cool down quicker, so I put it in the sink along with some ice and went on with my evening.\nIn the morning, my wife asks, what's that big jar in the (correction) sink? F*ing a. I left it in the shallow ice bath which is now lukewarm water. I check the temp of the water, it's 65f. No way it's safe.\nToday, I made chicken wings which were whole wings so with the scraps/tips, I decided let's make stock. I boiled it on the stovetop with some veggies for about 6 hours. I pour it into one of those huge mason jars, seal it up, and since it's cold outside, I figure let's put it in the snow. The second I set it down, the jar shatters from the cold.\nI can't catch a break."

Honestly, the basic version of that sauce already tastes really good.\nFor a more natural vibe, you could add chili oil instead of sriracha, use freshly grated horseradish instead of store paste, and honey instead of sugar.

Onion, garlic, and basic seasonings keep it straightforward. The sour cream adds a little tang and helps keep the loaf moist and tender. The bacon on top adds flavor and helps keep the meatloaf from drying out as it bakes. I include cheddar cheese because it helps break up the density of the meat and adds a little extra flavor, but the loaf still works well without it.\nIngredients\n1\u00bd lb (680 g) Ground beef\n\u00bd cup (50 g) Plain breadcrumbs\n1 Large egg\n\u00bd Sweet onion, finely chopped\n2 teaspoons Garlic powder\n1 teaspoon Mustard powder\n1 teaspoon Salt\n\u00bd teaspoon Black pepper\n1\u00bd Tablespoons Worcestershire sauce\n\u00bd cup (70 g) small cheddar cubes\n3 Tablespoons (45 g) Sour cream\nRegular-cut bacon strips (not thick-cut), enough to cover the top\nMethod\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\nIn a bowl, mix the ground beef, onion, garlic powder, mustard powder, salt, and pepper together. Then add the sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, egg, cheddar cubes, and breadcrumbs, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; that can cause the meatloaf to be tough.\nShape into an even loaf and place it in a buttered loaf pan.\nLay regular-cut bacon strips across the top in a single layer, touching.\nBake uncovered for 50\u201360 minutes, or until a meat thermometer reads 160\u00b0F (71\u00b0C) in the center and the bacon is crisp.\nRest 10 minutes before slicing.\nNote\nIf time allows, you can cover and refrigerate the shaped loaf for a few hours or overnight. This gives the breadcrumbs time to hydrate and helps the loaf hold together better. Let it sit at room temperature while the oven preheats so it isn\u2019t going in ice-cold.\nServing suggestion\nWhile the meatloaf bakes, cook a baked potato, baked sweet potato, or roasted winter squash in the oven at the same time."

Great Sous vide prep. Bulk prepping meals/leftovers is quicker, easier, and wont get freezer burn. We butcher/process about 1,000lbs of meat each year, so far its held up great after 500-600lbs, even running continuously on butcher days.

For the chunks I assume I could just do what I did now with the quarts.\nI'm also not sure of when to place them in the fridge. I thought they had to sit in the cupboard for a couple weeks and then once opened moved to the fridge. I don't see any mold so that's good.

As a student looking for close to 4K calories a day, the default options for lunch tend to be super time consuming stuff to cook, or super basic egg based dishes (which are boring to me).\nRecently been eating quite a lot of Prosciutto based sandwiches (like rocket (arugula) Parmesan, maybe pickled red onion), balsamic, olive oil. Either as quick lunches with minimal cleanup, or even as snacks.\nThe main reason I think, is I can often just pick up these ingredients, and they always get use in some form. I\u2019m a student, so can\u2019t rely on having lots of fridge space (e.g. I can\u2019t really buy and keep ingredients just for the occasional lunch dish). Also they\u2019re fairly cheap, and you can vary the sandwich a lot (Olive oil? Butter? Balsamic? All? Etc).\nFor example:\nProsciutto, I can always snack on. But I can also use it in some salads, or crisp it up, and use as an elevated topping for stuff. And it\u2019s not too expensive for what feels and tastes likes a more premium ingredient (not great value by weight, but in identity, definitely).\nRocket. Love how it can do everything from a versatile and not overpowering as a garnish to top dishes and bring freshness. But can be made into quite a nice base for salads to go with e.g. steak and chips or something.\nParmesan (or whatever Italian hard cheese). Lasts for ages in fridge, and valuable for any pasta dish, as well as in salads or tbh almost everywhere.\nThe rest are pretty core store cupboard stuff (pickled red onion slices are also my kind of default for a tangy acid brightness in salads, or to top some things).\nAnother variant for me is some tuna pasta salad. I  always keep tinned tuna+ pasta. So all I need to pick up is some feta, cherry tomato\u2019s, etc or whatever you want. Olive oil+ lemon juice and you have a solid lunch, that also doesn\u2019t feel as if it\u2019s just cobbled together (sometimes it does ngl).\nAnd stuff like feta lasts forever, can kind of be the core of a dis (often pasta or salads). or just top avocado on toast, shakshuka, Almost any tomato based thing etc.\nDo you have other kind of default meals/snacks that you gravitate towards due to convenience. And where the ingredients don\u2019t necessarily have to be bought for that purpose.\nI haven\u2019t purposely chosen Italian/Western European cuisine, but have kinda defaulted there (feel like pasta + students is an inevitable pairing)."

I know the people of Italy have access to higher fat milks and cheeses, allowing for greater flavors than what I can access here in Canada, but I need to at least try to make this at home. \nI can make a pretty good bake or non bake regular cheesecake at home, but I NEED this beautiful light and airy cheesecake in my life again, even if it's half as good I'll be happy.\nCould any of you suggest how to create a cheesecake that had a smooth flavor, without the brightness (lemon zest?) you usually find in homemade cheesecake, it was piped onto the plate (not necessary, I'd be fine to just scoop it out of a bowl), but with a texture of almost like a moose, the opposite of a usually dense cheesecake.\nAny pointers would be great,\nThanks all.\nI've found a photo of it from a review.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XPHWBfK\n*\nUPDATE #1\n*\nOk Everyone, here is the breakdown of the ingredients I went for after reading your several helpful tips, and a few recipes for cheesecake mousse.\n[Making the whipping cream] \n- 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream.\n- 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar.\nUsing a hand mixer I wiped the whipping cream to stiff peaks, slowly adding the sugar.  Once stiff peaks formed I covered the bowl and put it in my cold garage to chill.\n[Making the cream cheese/mascarpone mix]\n- 55g of cream cheese\n- 110g of mascarpone\n- 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar\n- 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract.\nUsing a hand mixer I wiped the mascarpone and cream cheese together until it was very smooth, slowly added the sugar, then mixed in the vanilla extract.  Covering it, putting it aside at room temp.\nSo, now, after dinner (wife is plating it right now), I will softly add some whipped cream into the mascarpone/cream cheese bowl, and mix together.  I'm not going to just dump all the whipped cream into the mascarpone as I want to slowly add it, as I want to keep the mascarpone/cream cheese flavour, and not dilute it by adding more whipped cream than it needs.\nTasting the mascarpone/cream cheese mix, I honestly think I could just stop right here and be happy.  It's happening, everyone, I think we did it.\n*\nUpdate #2\n*\nAnd here we are, years in the making.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6bC1sOf\nFirst off, it was very good. I'd be happy to serve it again even if I never improved on what I ate tonight, however there was room for improvement.\nThe flavor was smooth and at an appropriate level, and my god the ROI was great, it took no time to put together and you can dish it out well after you have completed preparing it, just keep it chilled.  Recently, I've been making chocolate or vanilla souffles for dessert, but they are annoying because you need to basically cook everything right then and there, nothing can be prepared beforehand, but with this cheesecake you could make it the day before and you just need to dish it out, so I'll 100% be using this as one of my go-to desserts in the future.\nWhat I could improve on:\n- First off, I was right about not mixing all of the whipped cream into the cheesecake mix, I only used half of the whipping cream in the cream cheese/mascarpone mix, as with each scoop of whipped cream you add it was another step away from the flavor I wanted. So next time I'll probably only use 1/4 of the whipping cream I had listed in my ingredients list.\n- Next, I wish I had also chilled the cream cheese/mascarpone mix, as I had thought the chilled whipping cream was going to bring down the temp of the room temperature cream cheese/mascarpone mix, but because I used so little of the whipping cream it was a little too warm, but that was just a learning mistake. \n- Maybe slightly more vanilla extract, and I'll also try using a vanilla bean.  The level of vanilla was nice, I'm just crazy for vanilla so I'll push it a little further, or maybe not because wife said it was perfect...\n- The biggest and most difficult change I want to make however is doing what\n/u/newbies13\nsuggested and trying a No2 siphon. As while this cheesecake was great, it didn't quite have the lightness I had remembered, and I believe this user is correct in saying it was probably run through a siphon, enforcing No2 into it, creating a lovely airy bite.  I believe once I get this No2 dialed in, I will only require a slight amount of whipped cream (or maybe not at all) to slightly reduce the cheesecake mix, allowing the cheesecake mix to work better with the No2 siphon, using the No2 to create the airy texture. Again, the more whipped cream, the more you reduce the best flavor, the cheesecake, so if the No2 adds the lightness while allowing me to keep 100% (plus maybe some required gelatin) of the cheesecake flavors, then we are laughing baby.\n- Also next time I'll add a buttery Bischoff crust, I do with all my cheesecakes, but tonight was all about the cream.\nFinally, to all of you, I did not think this was going to turn into a team effort, but it really did, and wow did you all have great insight.  Not only did you all point me in the right direction, but gave me every possible suggestion on improving the thing I've been lusting over for wayyyy too long.   So thank you, really, today was fun.\nI'll keep adding updates as I change the formula, getting it closer to what I consider to be almost perfection.\nGoodnight everybody."

On Saturday, I was hosting a brunch and used a few different methods to improve baking results and wanted to share.\n1) Pre-cooking the vegetables - for this particular quiche, I carmalized onions and sauteed mushrooms. I set them aside on a paper towel to drain off excess liquid.\n2) Par-baked the crust - admittedly, I not only wanted to give the crust a chance to crisp, but I had made a decorative edge that I wanted to preserve. I did a blind bake with pie weight to start, then pulled the crust from the oven, did additional docking on the bottom, and baked it a bit more without filling.\n3) Scrambled egg base - I placed some of the onion and mushroom filling directly into the bottom of the par-baked crust, but wanted a way to reduce cooking time, so the crust could remain crisp rather than soak up the wet eggs. I decided to pan-scramble eggs with about 1/3 of the mushroom and onions, then spread those on top of the veggie layer, so the scramble reached about 3/4 to the top of the crust, with space between.\nI then added shaved parmesean along with beaten eggs and milk to fill in the gaps. Then it went back in the oven to finish baking.\nThe results were lovely. The fillings were well dustributed, the texture was fluffy but firm, and the crust was flaky. Even though it took extra steps, I'd do this method again.\nMushroom & Onion Quiche"

But it smelled good, looked fine in its mineral form.\nI was going to be damned, as the offspring of 2 members of the silent generation, before I threw it out. So I chipped it out of the container, starting with a paring knife -- wound up cutting the package off with kitchen shears, good times.) Then, blitzed it in a mini-food processor, in batches. It threw up some dust lol. Then I put it into an airtight glass jar.\nI used it for a quick bread a couple of weeks ago, no ill effects. Last night, I used some in a soup recipe. It turned out perfectly, much to my own surprise. I have passed the powder through a sieve when using it, a bit of a pain. But I bought this stuff so I didn't have to throw out excess buttermilk! My goal is to use the rest in the next month or so, and start fresh, so to speak.\nThis is my message of thanks to everyone in this sub who has helped me to find the answer to some cooking question.

So I have my oil now which I used to make an awesome pasta, but I have a bowl of leftover shells and whatnot from the oil that I strained. I was doing some looking online and it said I can use it to make some fish stock. What would you guys recommend? Also I\u2019m not particularly wanting to roast them and eat them as is. Thanks!"

For me and my family, this has been a game-changer from our usual use of bagged frozen, peeled, devained shrimp. A sauce or rice made with shrimp stock just takes the dish to another level. Deheading and peeling the shrimp is quite a task, but it\u2019s worth it.\nPersonally, I\u2019m fine with leaving in the vein. I don\u2019t think comparing it to \u201cpoop\u201d is accurate, and I think I saw on a Jaques and Julia that Jaques is also ok with leaving it in (don\u2019t quote me on that).\nAnyway, we\u2019re having a dinner party next weekend and have settled on shrimp creole. Despite my ambivalence about the vein, I don\u2019t want to gross out my guests so they\u2019re coming out. But I\u2019m not excited about peeling and deveining 8 lbs of shrimp.\nSo:\n1) What\u2019s your preferred method for peeling and deveining? I\u2019m currently just working fingers up from the underside and pulling off the jacket with the tail, but there has to be a better way. I see tools specialized for the task on Amazon, but are those better than cutting up the back with a paring knife or shears?\n2) for deveining, am I crazy for not caring? When I devein, is there a method aside from slicing the back open? I don\u2019t like the splayed-out look and I think it makes the meat cook unevenly, but I\u2019m open to suggestions.\n3) if you use a tool, which one do you use?\n4) whats a good water to shell/head ratio for stock? I find my shrimp stock is quite cloudy\u2014is that normal? Any tips on shrimp stock?\n5) what wine would you pair with shrimp creole?\nThanks!"

As I didn\u2019t have anymore noodles so I had used those instead of noodles lol.\nBasically, I\u2019m trying new things and I do have some recipes in mind, like Garlic Butter Roasted Mushrooms and possibly Saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms, as they both look really good!! I would just love an idea for what mushroom to use for the recipes that wouldn\u2019t completely ruin my appetite for trying new things.\nFor what I do know I tend to dislike is textures like cantaloupe, I\u2019m very picky about taste but I feel like it just depends on how I would cook it.\nIf anyone has any suggestions, please share!! I\u2019d love some help!!\nUpdate: the mushrooms I had tried were enoki mushrooms! I loved the texture and flavor of them, if anyone has any similar i wouldnt mind the recommendation!!

I check it when I take the pan out of the oven, most of the pieces are usually over 165, but I keep checking a few pieces because I forget which I checked and which I didn\u2019t.  As they sit out, and I  assume cool off a bit, the temp doesn\u2019t go to 165 anymore.  Is this because the chicken isn\u2019t right out of the oven anymore? Or should it maintain 165 or up as the temperature it was fully cooked at? They do look fully cooked by site."

Recipes only seem to call for split lentils and there isn't a lot of info on substituting. I live in the US and had no idea there were so many different versions of red lentils. I got the Fiesta brand from the US Foods Chef'Store, if that helps. Apparently they are also called masoor gota or football red lentils.\nI'm wondering if anyone has tried subbing these instead of split lentils and if I need to make any alterations such as soaking longer, cooking longer, etc. If anyone has recipes that use this specific type of red lentils (or that work with them if you've tried it) I would greatly appreciate that as well since I have a lot of them and didn't realize what the different was until after I opened the bag."

        "body": "Early 2025 (around NYE), I got into an argument with my brother-in-law about whether San Marzano tomatoes are worth it and I said \"I'll prove it\" and then I became a person who owns a refractometer.\nHere, I tested 24 brands of canned whole peeled tomatoes, around 3 cans of each brand (to account for batch variation). One sauce recipe held constant and a blind taste panel of my wife and two friends who now regret knowing me.\nMethodology (skip if you don't care)\nSame sauce every time: 1 can tomatoes, 2 tbsp olive oil, 3 cloves garlic, 6 basil leaves, salt to taste. 45 min simmer in my\nLe Creuset.\nI measured brix (sugar content) with a digital refractometer, pH with a calibrated meter, and tomato-to-liquid ratio by weight. Temperature controlled with an IR thermometer because at some point I stopped being a normal person.\nBlind tasting would be my wife + 2 friends rotating, minimum 2 present per session. Identical white bowls, randomized order, 1-10 scales. Coordinating schedules was lowkey a nightmare as one of my friends stopped responding to texts by month 5.\nAll in all, that brings the total cost to\n$340.12\nin tomatoes.\nThe Rankings\nThe main finding was\nbrix correlated strongly with taste panel scores.\nThe best tomatoes came in around 5.6-5.8\u00b0Bx while the worst hovered at 4.6-4.8\u00b0Bx. It doesn't really sound like much but you can taste the difference. Higher sugar = more depth, less tinny/acidic flavor.\nGod Tier:\nBianco DiNapoli\n\u2014 5.8\u00b0Bx, $5.99/28oz. These are annoyingly good - California grown, not Italian, which pissed me off at first but they're just better than most imports. Perfect balance of sweet and acidic. Panel averaged 9.1.\nCento San Marzano DOP\n\u2014 5.6\u00b0Bx, $4.89/28oz. The real ones with DOP certification, very consistent across all 3 cans which is rarer than you'd think. Panel averaged 8.7.\nGreat:\nMutti\n\u2014 5.5\u00b0Bx, $4.50/28oz. Best value to quality ratio in the whole test. Italy's #1 brand and it shows. Panel averaged 8.2 - this is what I recommend to people who ask.\nRega\n\u2014 5.4\u00b0Bx, $4.99/28oz. Bright acidity, needed less added salt than most.\nLa Valle\n\u2014 5.3\u00b0Bx, $4.79/28oz. More rustic, less sweet, but in a good way.\nSolid:\nCento (non-DOP)\n\u2014 5.2\u00b0Bx, $3.49/28oz. Fine, respectable. Your aunt uses these and her sauce is good and you should stop being a snob.\nTuttorosso\n\u2014 5.1\u00b0Bx, $1.99/28oz. Surprised everyone. Domestic brand, clean flavor. Panel couldn't believe the price when I revealed it.\nCarmelina\n\u2014 5.1\u00b0Bx, $4.29/28oz. Underrated.\nMid:\n9-14. Red Gold, San Merican, Contadina, Good & Gather, Dei Fratelli, 365 Whole Foods -- they are all hovering 4.9-5.0\u00b0Bx. Good & Gather at $1.89 is honestly fine if you're broke, it beat several $4 cans which was embarrassing for those $4 cans.\nBad:\nHunt's\n\u2014 4.7\u00b0Bx, $1.99/28oz. Metallic aftertaste - all three panelists wrote \"tastes like the can\" independently.\n16-18. Del Monte, Kroger, store brands in the $1.50-2 range. Watery, thin, forgettable.\nCrimes against food:\n19-24. Bottom tier store brands I won't name. One had a brix reading of 4.6\u00b0Bx and tasted like tomato-flavored water. My friend rated one a 3 and just wrote \"why\" on the scoring sheet. These exist so that better tomatoes can feel good about themselves.\nConclusions (and also TL;DR)\nIf money's not an issue: Bianco DiNapoli and accept that $6 is the cost of transcendence. If you're normal: Mutti at $4.50 is the sweet spot. If you're broke: Tuttorosso at $2 punches way above its weight, genuinely nobody will know.\nMy wife has requested a 6 month break from tomato-based dishes. I've agreed to 3.\nEDIT:\nBrands 19-24 are in order: Great Value, Aldi Casa Mamita, ShopRite, Stop & Shop, Food Lion, Price Chopper. The difference between Bad (15-18) and Crimes (19-24) is that the Bad tier tastes like mediocre tomatoes. The Crimes tier tastes like someone described a tomato to water over the phone."
