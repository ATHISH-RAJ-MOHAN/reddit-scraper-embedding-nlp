This year we both got into The Apothacary Diaries, which is about a poison tester for Royalty who is...very enthusiastic about her job. So the theme is poisons!\nThe trouble is, we always cook together as part of our traditions, and I am wracking my brain trying to come up with poison themed food that isn't, ya know, *actually* poison. Alcohol maybe? Poison apples?\nAny help you can give is much appreciated! Again, please no -actual- poison. Feels like that goes without saying, but it's the internet, so..."

Regardless, I've been a \"trader ho\" for ages and have a slew of different \"recipes\" using their products \u2014 wanna start leaving 'em somewhere so here ya go!\nRecipe/Instructions:\nEither puncture vent holes or peel back small portion of plastic film from bowl.\nMicrowave acai bowl (from frozen) for 2 minutes.\nRemove plastic film entirely, stir fruit & puree, and mash any chunks of puree that are still frozen.\nMicrowave for another 2 minutes.\n*Microwave times may vary, but the goal should obviously be to\nwarm\nthe fruit thoroughly without burning it*\nBowl is hot and flimsy straight outta the microwave \u2014 you'll wanna have a firm grasp on it. Either leave it to cool in the microwave for another minute or so, or use oven mitts or paper towels to avoid dropping that bad boy all over the floor.\nWhile your fruit's cooking, prepare a plate with ~1 & 1/2 cups of your vanilla granola (plus the lil pack of granola the bowl comes with \u2014 'cause why not?)\nWhen the fruit is done, pour it on top of the granola & voila!\nYou'll want roughly equal parts granola:fruit, but the granola soaks the juice up pretty quickly either way.  These measurements are not exact.\nI can't imagine I'm the only one who's ever thought of this, but if you haven't \u2014 you're welcome \ud83d\udc95"

Combine the flour, salt and pepper, cover the beef in oil thoroughly, then toss it in the flour mixture.\nPreheat your oven to 270\\u00b0F. Put a Dutch oven on the stove on medium high heat. Add half the oil and half the butter for browning the meat. When it's hot, add half the beef, careful not to crowd the pan. Do it in 3 batches before you crowd the pan. Brown the beef well on at least two sides. Remove from pan and turn the heat off, remove the Dutch oven from the heat as well.\nAdd the onion, garlic, carrot, celery and leek. Return to heat and saute over medium heat until the aromatics have given up most of their water, the pan is deglazed, and the contents are starting to brown.\nAdd the vinegar and reduce it until it's almost gone, and the acidic smell is gone. Add the red wine and reduce it until it's alcohol free. Add the beef stock and stir to incorporate.\nAdd the bay leaves and add the beef back in, submerge it as much as possible. Bring to a simmer, cover. Bake at 270F for 2 hours, then turn the temperature down to 250F for two more hours, or until the beef is very tender and can be pulled with just a little resistance.\nRemove the beef from the braising liquid. Refrigerate overnight. Strain the liquid, discard the solids as they have served their purpose. Refrigerate the liquid overnight as well.\nDay 2:\nThe next day you should be able to lift off the fat cap from your liquid. Do so. Save in a bowl in the fridge.\nCarmelize your onions. Cut them into thin slices that are half moons. Add to a large saute pan with the beef fat, butter and salt. Mix constantly as the medium heat comes on, until everything is well integrated. Turn heat to very low and come back to stir every five minutes until the onions are carmelized, not just browned, about 1 hour.\nPrepare your bread. Using a food processor or immersion blender combine the raw garlic with the butter, beef fat, salt and pepper. Cut bigger baguettes in half then in half as for open face sandwiches. For shorter baguettes don't cut them in half first.\nBrush the interior surfaces of all the bread with the garlic mixture, lightly. Toast them until crispy. Allow to cool, set aside.\nPlace the remaining liquid on the stove, add the beef broth and stir. Bring to a simmer. Add 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce and salt and pepper to taste. Make a slurry of the cornstarch and water. Make sure there are no lumps. Add some to the braising liquid and stir until the liquid thickens. Use more as needed to achieve desired consistency.\nRemove the beef and onions from the refrigerator. Pull your beef into bite sized pieces with two forks. Place each in an oven proof bowl. Set the oven to 200F. Put the onions in one bowl, place in the oven. Put the beef in another bowl, add \\u2159 of the au jus and mix. Place in the oven, covered. Warm the beef and onions for 45 minutes. Reheat the buns in a warm oven. Reheat the au jus just before serving."
