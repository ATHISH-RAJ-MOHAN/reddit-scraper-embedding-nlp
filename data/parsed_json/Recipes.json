Either leave it to cool in the microwave for another minute or so, or use oven mitts or paper towels to avoid dropping that bad boy all over the floor.\nWhile your fruit's cooking, prepare a plate with ~1 & 1/2 cups of your vanilla granola (plus the lil pack of granola the bowl comes with \u2014 'cause why not?)\nWhen the fruit is done, pour it on top of the granola & voila!\nYou'll want roughly equal parts granola:fruit, but the granola soaks the juice up pretty quickly either way.  These measurements are not exact.\nI can't imagine I'm the only one who's ever thought of this, but if you haven't \u2014 you're welcome \ud83d\udc95",

Even when I\u2019m using recipes. It\u2019s always a huge effort peeling them off the grids.   No matter how much I grease the iron.  At first I thought it was because I was using egg whites instead of whole eggs, but now it even happens with whole eggs.  I literally cannot figure it out.  I\u2019m using recipes where I can use almond flour, cottage cheese or yogurt.  Does the anyone\u2019sw have a clue why it\u2019s failing? Thanks.",

DO NOT heat it too much or it might hamper with the flavor.\nAdd the minced garlic along with chilli flakes, and saut\u00e9 it. DO NOT brown the garlic, it's not traditionally done, unless you want a strong or bold flavor.\nAdd roughly chopped broccoli, and saut\u00e9 it. Flamb\u00e9-ing could also work and it results in a nice smoky flavor. Keep the heat high and toss your pan aggressively. Saut\u00e9 until it's cooked.\nAdd some reserved pasta water, helps binding the flavor to the pasta. Add a squeeze of lemon juice for that zesty flavor, I would also recommend to add some lemon zest. Add oregano/parsley. Season it well with salt and pepper.\nAdd your pasta and mix it well so that all the flavour is absorbed.\nNow crumble some feta on top to balance the sour flavour profile. Also adds some proteins.\nAnd, it's ready :). You can serve it on a plate or directly eat it from the pan. I would recommend to squeeze some lemon, drizzle some olive oil and sprinkle more parsley before digging in."

Then transfer the biga to the refrigerator overnight for 12 to 48 hours.\nRemove the biga from the refrigerator. It will look fully hydrated, expanded and should be a little bubbly.\nInto a large bowl add the water, all of the biga, 3 tablespoons of oil and stir to combine.

Cover with plastic wrap and set it in a warm corner of your kitchen for 30 minutes.\nWet your hands to stretch and fold the dough. To do this, scoop your fingers down the sides of the bowl so they meet under the dough in the middle. Lift the dough up above the bowl. Lift and fold the dough over itself 3 times. Coming from different edges of the dough each time. Cover with plastic wrap. Repeat this process every 30 minutes for the next 2 \u00bd hours.\nPlace a sheet of parchment paper in the bottom of a 9\u00d713 cake pan. Generously coat the parchment paper with \u2153 cup oil. Place the dough on the baking sheet or pan, and turn it over gently to coat.\nUsing the tips of your fingers gently insert into the dough in multiple places, creating dimples and stretching the dough gently toward the edges of the pan. Do this 3 to 4 times over the next 1 to 1 \u00bd hours.\nPreheat the oven to 450\u00b0F.\nBefore the final dimple, drizzle 3 tablespoons of oil over the dough and sprinkle with kosher salt.\nPlace the pan in the oven and bake for 28-35 minutes. When it\u2019s done it should be golden brown with darker brown bubbles. Remove from the oven.\nGive it about 5 minutes to cool, then transfer it to a cutting board. It should be crisp on the outside, tender, slightly chewy and full of air pockets on the outside."

Whisk to combine all dry ingredients.\nIn a small cup, add milk and 1 tsp of lemon juice. Mix to combine and let stand for ~3 minutes (note: this creates a \"butter milk\"). Add vanilla and egg. Use a fork to break your egg and mix all of the wet ingredients together.\nTo the centre of your medium bowl filled with dry ingredients, add your wet ingredient mixture. Use a spatula to mix together all ingredients. This is your batter. It will be thick.\nAdd your chopped/diced apples to your batter and continue to fold ingredients until all of the apple has been evenly mixed in.\nApple Fritter Glaze\nIn a small bowl, add your icing sugar, butter, apple butter, and 2 tsp of lemon juice. Mix. If still too thick to spread, continue to add drops of lemon juice to thin out the glaze. The final glaze should be fairly loose and spreadable.\nAir Frying\nPreheat your air fryer to 400 F for 2-4 minutes.\nOnce your Air Fryer has preheated, remove the air fryer basket and carefully drop in an air fryer sized parchment liner into the basket. Use a cooking spray (note: I used avocado spray but any light cooking spray will work) to lightly spray the parchment liner.\nAdd a scoop of batter (2-3 tbsp in size) into the baking tray. (note: depending on the size of your air fryer, you will be able to make room for 2-3 fritters).\nSpray the tops of each fritter with cooking spray.\nAir Fry at 400F for about ~4.5 minutes. Pause air fryer, flip the apple fritters over, spray once more with oil, and fry for another ~4.5 minutes.\nYou will know that the fritters are done when the edges have started to turn brown and the apple fritters have puffed up and are crackling.\nCarefully remove from the air fryer and place on to a cooling rack. Repeat air frying process with the next batch of apple fritters.\nGlazing\nPlace a parchment paper below a cooling rack (note: this is for your glazed apple fritters as glaze may drip down onto this).\nAdd a spoonful of glaze to each apple fritter and spread it flat until it has covered the surface of the fritter. Continue until all baked fritters are glazed.\nOnce glaze has solidified, your Air Fryer Apple Fritters are ready to enjoy!"

This is a very traditional recipe here and it\u2019s very simple fast and good taste with little effort:\n1) Put olive oil in a pan, medium low heat \n2) Press a garlic head using the knife horizontally, don\u2019t cut it! And put it in the oil. \n3) When the garlic start tickling put the cherry tomatoes some cut in vertical in a half some cut in 4 part still vertically\n4) In the meantime put the water on the heat \n5) Keep the heat under the pan medium low, add salt and let the tomato start to lose liquids\n6) When the water boil add the pasta and the salt.\n7) Add a ladleful of water (that now is salted and it has also the starch from the pasta) to the cherry tomatoes little by little. And let the tomato start building a cream\n8) Add the basil in the tomato \n9) When the pasta is a little before the \u201cal dente\u201d put the pasta in the tomato and another little ladle of water and let the pasta finish to cook with the tomato.\n10) Mix pasta and tomato good in the pan on low heat\n11) Turn off the heat wait 1/2 min and add parmeasan and mix again \n12) Serve and enjoy simplicity but with good timing that makes everything better \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\n\ud83e\ude84 Tips and tricks: sometime we adjust with a little bit of sugar (this is just because our tomatoes are pure natural so sometimes the sugar help with the acidity), if you use yellow tomatoes try to add grated lemon zest at the end (not a lot).\nSome general info too here: \nWe don\u2019t use onion or vegetable stock for this recipe. \nHere we are not used to blend the tomato or smash them cause we have the best tomato in the world so being the quality very high if you cook them in the right manner they will squash and blend with the pasta by themselves. \nWe have tons of or recipe with the cherry tomatoes. \nOh also to answer to another comment on this discussion: \u201csalsa marinara\u201d it\u2019s only on pizza in Italy. We don\u2019t use it for pasta."

Heat at 600W for 30\u201340 seconds, then stir in the chopped green onion.\nSlice the chicken and drizzle with the scallion sauce before serving.\nTips & Notes\n\u30fbPounding the chicken breast with a rolling pin before cooking is an important step that helps produce a juicy, tender fried chicken.\n\u30fbIf you prefer a milder flavor, microwave the minced Japanese long onions together with B.\n\u30fbAdjust the amount of sugar in the sauce to your taste.\n\u30fbFreezer-friendly: store the fried chicken separate from the sauce for up to 3 weeks."

Make caramel:\nIn a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Heat over medium until the syrup turns dark amber. Once the bubbles become small and smoke starts to appear, remove from heat. Carefully add boiling water (it may splatter), swirl, and pour into a loaf pan, tilting to coat the bottom evenly. Let cool.\n2. Cook the sweet potato:\nPlace sweet potato and water in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave at 600W for about 3 minutes, until fork-tender.\n3. Blend the custard base:\nIn a blender, combine cooked sweet potato, heavy cream, milk, eggs, sugar, and vanilla. Blend until completely smooth. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve for extra silkiness.\n4. Steam-bake:\nPour custard mixture into the caramel-lined pan. Place the pan in a frying pan lined with a paper\u00a0 towel, and pour hot water into the pan until it reaches the same height as the custard. Place a lid on the frying pan and heat on medium-low, keeping the water at about 175\u00b0F (80\u00b0C); do not let it boil! Adjust the heat as necessary and steam for 45 minutes.\n5. Chill:\nLet cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 6 hours before serving.\nTips\nThe darker the caramel, the more bitter the flavor\u2014adjust to taste.\nAvoid boiling the water bath; too much heat will cause the pudding to develop air pockets. If it starts to boil, lower or turn off the heat.\nSome loaf pans may leak from the corners; test with water beforehand, or wrap the pan tightly with foil."

Cook onion until tender, add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Cook the ground beef (or alternative, see notes) until no longer pink about 5 minutes. Drain the fat.\nReturn the pot to the heat and add the tomatoes, kidney beans, mushrooms, chilli powder, paprika, cumin, chilli flakes, broth, and pasta. Stir and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the pasta is al dente, 14-15 minutes.\nRemove from heat and stir in shredded and cream cheese until melted.\n**Notes**: Olive oil may be substituted with butter or other oil. Ground beef substitutes well with Beyond Beef, but needs to cook a bit longer until firm. For broth, I use beef broth with beef and vegetable broth with Beyond Beef. For a hot sauce, I use Nando\u2019s Medium or Garlic or a cajun garlic flavour. Entirely optional, as are the chilli flakes"

Grease the base and sides of a 20cm springform cake tin.\nMelt the butter in a small saucepan over a medium-low heat. Put the biscuits in a food processor and blitz to fine crumbs. Add the melted butter and pulse a few times to evenly coat the crumbs.\nTip the buttery crumbs into the prepared tin and spread out over the base, pressing down firmly with the back of a spoon to create a compact, flat, even layer \u2013 particularly into the edges of the tin.\nPlace the tin on the hot baking tray and bake for 20 mins until golden \u2013 this will help the base stay extra crisp. Set aside to cool. Reduce the oven temperature to gas \u00bc, 110\u00b0C, fan 90\u00b0C \u2013 leaving the baking tray in the oven. Once the base is cool, brush with the egg white \u2013 this will help seal the base and stop it going soggy when the filling is added.\nPut the soft cheese in a large mixing bowl and beat with an electric whisk on medium/low speed for 1 min until smooth. Add the soured cream cornflour, sugar and vanilla extract and beat gently until just combined, scraping down the side to make sure everything is incorporated.\nAdd the beaten eggs a little at a time, beating after each addition until just combined. Once smooth stop beating to prevent it from becoming over-worked.\nPour the filling into the tin over the base. Tap the tin gently on the work surface to level the top and remove any air bubbles. Place on the preheated baking tray and bake for 1\u00bd hrs, until just set with a slight wobble in the middle \u2013 if it seems very wobbly, return to the oven for an extra 5-10 mins.\nTurn off the oven and leave the cheesecake to cool completely inside \u2013 running a palette knife around the edge of the cheesecake can help prevent cracking as it shrinks away from the sides as it cools.\nFor the topping, mix together the soured cream, sugar and lemon juice in a bowl. Remove the completely cool cheesecake from the oven and pour the soured cream mix over the top, spreading it out with a palette knife or spoon to form a smooth layer right up to the edges of the tin.\nLoosely cover the whole tin with tin foil and chill in the fridge for at least 8 hrs or overnight.\nWhen ready to serve, uncover, run a palette knife around the edge of the cheesecake then unclip the tin.

Using a rubber spatula, mix until the water is absorbed and the ingredients form a sticky dough ball.\nCover the bowl with a damp tea towel and set aside in a warm spot to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the dough has doubled.\nPreheat oven to its hottest setting, 550\u00b0F.\nSprinkle a work surface liberally with flour. Turn the dough out onto your floured surface and use a bench scraper to divide the dough into 2 equal portions. With floured hands, roll each portion into a ball, using the pinkie-edges of your hands to pinch the dough underneath each ball. If you are not baking the pizza the same day, transfer each round of dough to a plastic quart container, cover, and store in the fridge. (At this point you can transfer the vessels to the freezer for up to 3 months). If you are baking right away, let the balls sit on their tucked-in edges for at least 30 minutes without touching.\nIf using refrigerated dough, pull out a pizza round from the fridge one hour before you plan on baking. Dust dough with flour and place on a floured work surface. Cover the dough with a towel to prevent it from drying out. Let rest for 60-90 minutes.\nHandling the dough as minimally as possible, shape the dough into a 10\u2033\u201312\u2033 round. If the dough has proofed sufficiently, you should be able to pick it up and stretch it very easily using the back of your hands. Place dough on a cornmeal dusted pizza pan.\nAssembly\nSpread tomato sauce over your pizza dough using the back of a large spoon. Top with shredded mozzarella cheese, sliced onions, pepperoni and black olives.\nBake pizza until top is blistered, about 5 minutes. Transfer to cutting board. Cut and serve."

This will include cleaning all the shrimp if they\u2019re not deveined, and scrubbing off any gunk from the crab legs and mussels.\nAlso, husk the corn, then cut the corn into thirds. Then wash the potatoes until the water runs clean. Then precook the potatoes for 10-12 minutes and the corn for 10 minutes.\nWhile the corn and potatoes are precooking, chop the sausages into 1 inch pieces, mince the garlic, cut the lime or lemon in half and measure out the butter. At this point, you should also preheat your oven to\u00a0around 375\u00b0F or 190\u00b0C while gathering all the ingredients needed in one place.\nNext, grab the oven bag and a large deep pot or bowl and place the bag into the pot to help make placing the seafood and vegetables into the bag a bit easier.\nNext, add the crab legs to the bottom of the oven bag.\nYou can add more crab legs if you have them. This is just what I had on hand at the moment.\nThen add the precooked corn and potatoes.\u00a0Also add the mussels, sausages and\nshrimp\n.\nLastly add the cajun seasoning, chopped garlic, lime juice, and melted butter to the bag.\nUse tongs to mix well until all the seafood and vegetables inside of the oven bag are fully coated with the butter and cajun seasoning mixture, then tie the bag closed and place it on a baking sheet lined with foil.\nPlace in the preheated oven for 25\u201330 minutes.\nOnce cooked, remove from the oven. You can either enjoy this as a delicious cajun seafood boil bag recipe (see tips below on how to make cajun seafood boil bags), or pour out the cooked seafood onto a baking sheet. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve with your favorite seafood sauce."

It\u2019s not only cooling but also packed with vitamins and minerals. Let\u2019s get started!\nIngredients:\n2 medium beets, boiled and grated\n800 ml of ayran (or kefir)\n2 cucumbers, finely chopped or grated\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n3\u20134 stalks of green onion, finely chopped\nLemon juice to taste\nSalt and pepper to taste\nFinely chopped herbs (cilantro, dill, parsley)\n2 hard-boiled eggs, grated\nExtra eggs and herbs for serving\nPreparation:\nIn a large bowl, mix together the beets, cucumber, eggs, green onion, herbs, and garlic. Pour in the ayran (or kefir) and stir well.\nAdd lemon juice gradually, along with salt and pepper to taste. Just a heads up \u2014 beets tend to add a slight sweetness, so feel free to adjust the lemon juice depending on how tangy you like it.\nChill the soup in the fridge before serving.

Gently continue to massage into a scrappy dough. If it needs 1/2 tsp-1 tsp of water, sprinkle it over and continue to bring together. It will be a bit dry at first, but continue to work with it.\nOnce all of the flour is worked into your dough, it is time to knead it. Begin by folding and turning, folding and turning. Continue for 3-4 minutes, or until it is smooth, but too tough to fold anymore.\nWrap loosely with plastic wrap and let the dough sit to rest for about 30 minutes. This gives the tight bonds of the gluten strands you created while kneading, a chance to relax and loosen a bit so that the dough can be worked with again."

        "top_comment": "recipe link\nMaking the Brioche Dough\nIngredients\n1/4 cup whole milk (60 ml)\n2 1/4 tsp active-dry yeast (7 g)\n1/4 cup white, granulated sugar (50 g)\n2 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (300 g)\n1 tsp salt\n2 large eggs\n6 tbsp butter, softened (85 g)\nDirections\nIn a liquid measuring cup or bowl, heat milk in the microwave until it reaches 100 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 43 degrees Celsius). Stir in yeast and sugar and let sit to bloom for 10 minutes.\nIn a larger bowl, add in your flour, salt, and eggs. Once your milk and yeast mixture has bloomed, pour into the bowl as well. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the liquid measuring cup or bowl so no sugar or yeast gets left behind.\nUsing a mixer with a dough hook, knead all the ingredients together on low speed until combined. You should have a homogenous dough with all the flour incorporated. (You can also knead by hand, but it will take longer.)\nWith the mixer still on low speed, add in a piece of softened butter, about one to two tablespoons at a time. Make sure each piece is fully incorporated into the dough before adding the next. This process of slowly incorporating each piece of butter can take several minutes.\nOnce all the butter has been added and incorporated, continue kneading the dough on low speed for about 5-10 minutes, or until the dough has passed the \u201cwindowpane test\u201d \u2013 test the dough by taking a small piece of it and slowly stretching it into a thin sheet between your fingers and see if light can pass through the dough without it tearing in the process. Dough should be smooth, elastic, and tacky but not sticky.\nTransfer your dough into a different bowl greased with oil. Cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 60-75 minutes. Meanwhile make the filling and glaze.\nMaking the Filling\nIngredients\n6 tbsp butter, softened (85 g)\n1/2 cup brown sugar (100 g)\n1 tbsp cinnamon\nDirections\nStir all the ingredients in a bowl until thoroughly combined. You should have a filling that is thick but spreadable.\nMaking the Glaze\nIngredients\n1 cup powdered sugar (120 g)\n1 tbsp butter, melted (14 g)\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n2 tbsp milk (30 ml)\nDirections\nWhisk all the ingredients together in a bowl until smooth.\nBaking the Rolls\nDirections\nTransfer dough to a floured surface.\nUsing a rolling pin dusted in flour, roll out the brioche dough to about 8 by 22 inches (20 by 56 cm). You may periodically need to flip the dough over and flour both sides of the dough to make sure nothing sticks.\nSpread the filling evenly across the surface of the dough.\nStarting from one of the shorter sides of the dough, roll the dough up into a tight spiral/log.\nTrim off any excess dough at the ends of log. Then cut the log of dough into 8 equal pieces.\nPlace the pieces into 2 greased 6-inch cake pans. You can also place all 8 pieces into 1 larger 9-inch pan.\nCover and let the rolls rise for 30-40 minutes, or until almost doubled in size.\nPre-heat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\nBake cinnamon rolls for 16-20 minutes. If all the rolls are in one larger 9-inch pan, bake for 20-25 minutes. If you have an instant-read thermometer, the internal temperature of the center of the dough should reach 190\u00b0F (88\u00b0C) when it is fully cooked.\nLet cool for about 10 minutes before spreading the glaze on the rolls.\nServe and enjoy!"

        "top_comment": "Halabessa, also known as Hummus el Sham, is an Egyptian soup\u2014or drink, as they often call it in Egypt\u2014with a spicy kick and the warming aroma of cumin. It\u2019s the kind of thing that sparks up your appetite in no time. Halabessa is a popular street food, especially during chilly winter days in places like Cairo and Alexandria. It\u2019s not just about warming your body\u2014it really does something for the soul too.\nStreet vendors usually serve it in disposable cups with a lemon wedge and a pinch of shatta (hot red pepper) on the side.\nAnd the best part? You don\u2019t need any professional cooking skills to make it. It's very straightforward.\nIngredients\nMain:\n1 cup dried chickpeas\n1 medium tomato, quartered\n1 medium onion\n2 garlic cloves\n\u00bd cup tomato sauce or 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)\nCumin (to taste)\nShatta (chili or cayenne pepper, to taste)\nTo serve:\nSalt\nGround cumin\nChili or cayenne pepper\nLime or lemon wedges\nHow to Make It\n1. Soak the chickpeas:\nRinse the chickpeas and soak them in water for at least 3 hours (overnight is even better). Change the water once or twice if possible.\n2. Cook the chickpeas:\nDrain the chickpeas, place them in a pot, cover with fresh water, and bring to a boil over high heat.\n3. Add the onion and simmer:\nLower the heat to medium. Cook the chickpeas for 30\u201345 minutes, skimming off any foam. Add the whole onion (and optionally a bay leaf for extra aroma).\n4. Remove onion and adjust liquid:\nTake out and discard the onion. The chickpeas should still be covered in plenty of water. If the soup looks too thick, add 1\u20132 cups of hot water.\n5. Add blended tomato mix:\nBlend the tomato, garlic, and tomato sauce or paste (add a little water if you're using paste), then pour it into the pot. Stir, add salt and spices, and cook for another 10\u201315 minutes.\n6. Serve:\nServe the soup hot, with spices and a lemon or lime wedge on the side.\nLeftovers:\nStore in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Reheat as needed.\nNotes:\nI always prefer using dried chickpeas\u2014they absorb all the good flavor from the garlic and onion during cooking.\nAdjust the spice level to suit your taste. You can go mild or fiery\u2014it\u2019s totally up to you."

Press the crust into an 8-inch round tart pan. If desired, use the bottom of a small measuring cup to tamp the crust down evenly. Set aside.\nIn a bowl, stir together the room temperature mascarpone cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla bean paste (or extract), and almond extract until creamy and well combined. Spread evenly over the prepared crust. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour \u2013 this will ensure it slices cleanly during serving.\nThe day of serving, slice the strawberries. Trim off the stems and slice vertically into thin slices. Remove the tart from the fridge and distribute the strawberry slices onto the mascarpone filling \u2013 feel free to arrange or decorate as desired. To achieve a similar look as the photos above: starting from the outside of the tart and working your way in, layer the strawberry slices next to each other, in a circular pattern with the pointed ends facing out. Repeat, layering the strawberry slices slightly with each circle and so forth.\nDrizzle the tart with honey. Garnish with sliced almonds and mint, if using. Serve immediately or keep in the fridge, covered loosely with plastic wrap if needed, until serving."

Blackening Seasoning\nDIRECTIONS:\nPreheat your oven to 400F. Take 24 - 36 dill pickle chips and pat them dry on a few paper towels.\nGrab a non-stick 12-cup muffin tin. Spray with non-stick cooking spray if desired. Fill each cup with a big pinch of shredded cheese. Top each cheese cup with two or three dill pickle chips. Next you'll sprinkle on your favorite seasoning blend (I used blackening) into each cup and top with more cheese to cover the pickles.\nBake for 15 minutes, or until cheese has melted and browned.\nOPTIONAL: After they have baked, removed each cheesy pickle chip from the muffin tin and place them in the air fryer at 400F for 5 minutes for extra crispy.\n5.Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce. I love these with homemade ranch or tangy Alabama white sauce."

Separately, beat the eggs and vanilla together and pour this mixture into the double boiler, constantly mixing to avoid creating your breakfast scrambled eggs.\nNext, add in the baking soda, salt and 2/3 of the flour, mixing until the dough begins to thicken, once it starts taking shape, take it off the heat and mix in the remaining flour.\nLet the dough cool a little bit and knead it with your hands to get to a smooth consistency. Divide into 8 equal parts and cover with a damp kitchen towel to avoid letting it dry out.\nDust your work surface with some flour, and roll out a thin circle slightly bigger than the lid of your cake tin (approx. 23-25cm). Transfer to the baking tray and bake for 4-5mins, keeping an eye on the process as to not burn the layers. Repeat for the rest of the layers.\nAs they turn golden brown, take them out the oven, and cut out a circle whilst they are still hot.\nFor the filling, beat the sour creme and double cream, sugar and vanilla until the sugar is incorporated and the whole mixture has double in size. Fill each layer of the cake except for the top and sides.\nFor the frosting, whisk the mascarpone with the icing sugar, vanilla and double cream until stiff peaks. Cover the top and optionally sides of the cake with the frosting.\nIt is highly recommended to leave the cake sit in the fridge overnight or 24h before service to allow the layers to soak in the filling."

Actual cook time depends on the size of cut pieces.\nAllow roast to rest at room temp at least 5-10 minutes before slicing.

Steep for 4\u20135 minutes (do not over-steep to avoid bitterness).\nRemove the tea bags or strain out loose leaves.Stir in 120\u2013140g of white sugar while the tea is still hot, ensuring it dissolves completely.\nAllow the sweet tea to cool down to room temperature (21\u201327\u00b0C).\nThis is crucial! Never add a scoby to hot tea\u2014heat can kill the live bacteria and yeast.\nStep 2: Add the SCOBY & Starter Tea\nTransfer the cooled tea into a clean 2-litre glass jar.\nAdd 100ml of starter kombucha tea (usually comes with a scoby). The starter tea helps lower the pH and prevents bad bacteria from growing.\nGently place the SCOBY into the jar. It may float, sink, or sit sideways\u2014all of these are fine!\nStep 3: Cover & Ferment\nCover the jar with a breathable cloth, muslin, or a coffee filter and secure it with an elastic band.\nPlace the jar in a warm, dark place at room temperature (21\u201327\u00b0C) for 7\u201314 days.\nTip:\nAvoid direct sunlight, extreme temperature changes. Warmer temperatures (25\u201327\u00b0C) will ferment kombucha faster, while cooler temperatures (21\u201323\u00b0C) will slow the process.\nStep 4: Taste & Monitor Fermentation\nStart tasting after 7 days using a clean spoon. If it's too sweet, let it ferment longer. If it's too sour, reduce fermentation time next batch. A new baby SCOBY will start forming on top\u2014this is a sign of healthy fermentation! If old scoby floats at the top, the new scoby will attach itself to a old one.\nBlog Post:\nKombucha Guide"

The purpose of the can is to keep constant downward pressure on the ricotta, to press out as much liquid as possible.\nLet the ricotta drain in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours, or optimally overnight.\nOnce the ricotta has drained, preheat the oven to 350\u2109.\nRemove the phyllo cups from their packaging and place in a mini-muffin tin or on a parchment lined baking sheet.\nBake on the middle rack of the oven for 10 minutes, then let cool.\nIn the meantime, to make the cannoli filling, simply whisk together the drained ricotta, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract.\nOnce the phyllo cups have cooled, simply fill them with the ricotta cream, using either a piping bag and tip for a fancy detail, or just gently spooning it in with a small spoon.\nIf you prefer to have a chocolate edge to the phyllo cups, you'll need to do one additional step before filling them with the ricotta cream. Melt chocolate melting wafers in a microwave for 30 seconds at a time until smooth.\nCarefully dip the edges of the phyllo cup in the melted chocolate, then immediately add any toppings you like before the chocolate sets.\nFinally, fill with the ricotta cannoli cream, add a sprinkle of any additional toppings, and enjoy your mini cannoli bites!"

Place all the ingredients for the filling except the spring onions (scallions) in another mixing bowl and beat together until well combined.

Roll the dough into a long sausage and split it into 8 equal-sized pieces (65\u201370g), then roll each one into a ball.\nFlatten the dough balls and roll each into a wrapper about 15cm (6in) in diameter. Place 2 tablespoons of filling in the middle of each wrapper, top with the spring onions, and pinch the dough closed. Place the buns pinch-side down on a tray lined with baking paper, spaced not less than 1cm (\u00bdin) apart, and leave to rise for at least 15 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 200\u00b0C (400\u00b0F/Gas 6). Beat the remaining egg and brush the tops of the buns with it before sprinkling with the sesame seeds. Bake in the oven for about 25-35 minutes, or until the tops of the buns are golden and crisp.

Cover and cook for 25 minutes over medium high heat.\nAdd the pork and cook for another 10 minutes.\nRemove the pot from the heat. Take out the anchovies, kelp and mushrooms.\nSlice the mushrooms into bite size pieces.\nStrain the mixture of the stock and the pork into a large bowl.\nPut the pork into a small bowl. You will get about 6 cups of stock.\nStir in the salt until dissolved.\nMake seasoning paste:\nCombine the seasoning paste ingredients \u2013 garlic, hot pepper paste, hot pepper flakes, soy sauce, sugar, and water in a bowl. Mix well.\nArrange the ingredients in a shallow pot (10 to 12 inch):\nPut the cabbage, onion, green onion, pork, and the mushrooms, on the bottom of the pot.\nAdd the kimchi, and the seasoning paste over top.\nAdd the spam, sausage, rice cake, tofu, baked beans, and cheese.\nAdd the ramyeon and the sweet potato starch noodles.\nPut radish sprouts on top and add 3 cups of stock.\nCook and serve:\nCook over medium high heat. Korean style is to cook at the table with a portable burner. Friends and family will be sitting around the pot, talking and laughing, and maybe drinking. You can take a bit of cooked sausage or the meat with your chopsticks as you wait for the broth to boil and the noodles to soften. If you don\u2019t have a tabletop burner, you can cook it on the stove away from the table.\nWhen it starts boiling about 10 minutes later, stir and turn the ingredients over with tongs to cook evenly.\nServe right after the noodles and ramyeon have softened. Transfer some cooked stew to individual bowls and serve. Add more stock as the broth boils down."

Drain the water thoroughly, mash the potatoes, or pass them through a potato ricer to make a smooth pur\u00e9e. You should have no more than\n500 grams\nof mashed potatoes. Set the pur\u00e9e aside to cool. Add\n1/2 level teaspoon\neach of salt and pepper to the mashed potatoes.\nTip:\nCooked potatoes are easiest to process while still slightly warm. Pass them through a ricer or grinder for a smooth texture. If using a grinder, you can also process leftover potatoes from the previous day, even if they are cold.\nPeel and finely chop a large onion (or use several smaller ones weighing around\n300 grams in total\n). Heat two tablespoons of vegetable oil in a pan. Add the chopped onion and saut\u00e9 over medium heat for about\n10 minutes\nuntil softened.\nFor the filling, you'll need\n300 grams of farmer's cheese\n. Use semi-fat or full-fat cheese sold in blocks (not pre-ground). Pass the cheese through a grinder or a potato ricer for the best texture. Avoid using creamy, pre-ground cheese sold in tubs, as it tends to be too soft for the filling.\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, ground farmer's cheese, saut\u00e9ed onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix everything thoroughly. Taste and add more salt and pepper to your liking. Your pierogi filling is ready.\nInstructions for the Dough:\nTo make the dough, sift 500 grams of flour into a large bowl (this is half of a standard 1-kilogram package). Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt, four tablespoons of oil (e.g., rapeseed or grapeseed oil), and one cup of hot, boiled water. Stir the dough with a spoon, then knead it until smooth. The dough should be soft, pliable, and elastic.\nShape the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest for\n30 minutes\n.\nResting prevents the dough from shrinking during rolling.\nAfter resting, unwrap the dough and divide it into three portions. Keep two portions covered with a clean kitchen towel to prevent drying out while you work with the first.\nRoll out one portion of dough on a floured surface to a thin sheet. Use a round cutter or glass (around 8 cm in diameter) to cut out circles. Place a generous amount of filling in the center of each circle. Flatten the filling slightly into a log shape to fit well. Fold the dough over to create a half-moon shape and press the edges firmly to seal. Optionally, crimp the edges for a decorative pattern.\nTip:\nCollect and knead any leftover dough scraps into a ball, roll them out again, and cut more circles. Leftover dough can also be used to make dumplings.\nPlace the prepared pierogi on a lightly floured surface. Cover them with a slightly damp kitchen towel to keep them from drying out while you prepare the rest.\nBoil a large pot of salted water. Add pierogi in batches, ensuring the water is simmering but not boiling vigorously. Cook for about\n3\u20134 minutes\nafter the pierogi float to the surface. Remove them with a slotted spoon.\nServe the pierogi with butter and saut\u00e9ed onions. Prepare the topping just like the onions used in the filling but slice them instead of chopping."

Mix cumin, paprika, brown sugar, salt, and pepper in a small bowl, and sprinkle mixture evenly over chicken thighs. When the oil is hot, lay thighs in oil, leaving untouched for about four minutes per side, then remove them to a plate and set aside. They should be nicely browned, but don't need to be fully cooked when removed.\nMeanwhile, mince garlic, and set aside in a small bowl with a sprinkle of kosher salt. Mince vegetables by pulsing in batches in a food processor until the texture of coarse sand. Add butter to the warm oil in the Dutch oven, and add the veggies when this is melted. Add kosher salt, allow to cook until very soft. 10-30 minutes.\nAdd herbs and garlic, and cook for another 5 minutes.\nAdd white wine, scrape tasty bits from the bottom of the pan, add chicken stock and beans.\n(optional, but will result in creamy texture) Remove about 1.5 cups of soup to a bowl or measuring cup and use an immersion blender to puree. Return this to the soup. Add chicken thighs,\u00a0cook for another 15-20 minutes, until chicken is tender enough to shred.\nRemove chicken thighs, shred them, return to pot. Add kale, cover until wilted.\nServe hot."

Cook for 4 minutes, until the egg whites have set and the yolks are glossed over but still jammy.\nTo serve, divide the bread among the soup bowls. Wish a slotted spoon, remove the poached eggs out of the soup and place atop the bread in the bowls. Ladle the soup into the bowls.\nServe sprinkled with chopped cilantro and scallions."

Cook and stir the onion until it becomes translucent, then add the chopped celery and carrot. Season them with salt and pepper. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring the vegetables to coat them well.\nAdd the ground meat, a generous pinch of salt, and pepper. Break up the meat with a fork, stir well, and cook until the meat loses its raw red color.\nAdd the milk and let it simmer gently, stirring constantly, until it has completely bubbled away.Add the peeled lemon zests, and stir.\nAdd the wine, let it boil until evaporated completely (it will take about 20 to 30 minutes). Taste it and season it as needed.\nAdd the tomatoes and stir well to coat all the ingredients. Taste it and season as needed.\nWhen the tomatoes start bubbling, reduce the heat as much as possible to let the sauce cook slowly, with only an intermittent bubble rising to the surface.\nCook, uncovered, for 3 hours or more (6 hours for maximum flavor), stirring occasionally. Check it every 20-30 minutes. As the sauce cooks, you will likely notice it starting to dry out and the fat separating from the meat. To prevent sticking, add \u00bd cup of water whenever necessary.\nIn the end, however, there should be no water left, and the fat should separate from the sauce. Stir to mix the fat into the sauce, taste, and season it.\nAdd a ladle of the pasta cooking water if you want it to be more saucy. Add the cooked pasta into the bolognese pot and mix it so the sauce completely coats the pasta.\nServe with grated cheese and enjoy the best bolognese ever!"

Juicy, flavorful chicken, wrapped in soft laffa, topped with fresh veggies, tangy pickles, and a drizzle of garlic sauce... it\u2019s seriously next-level.\nIngredients for the Chicken Shawarma\n650\u00a0g\u00a0boneless\u00a0-\u00a0skinless chicken thighs\nJuice of half a lemon\n3\u00a0garlic cloves\u00a0-\u00a0minced\n1\u00a0tsp\u00a0minced ginger\n1\u00a0tbsp\u00a0extra virgin olive oil\u00a0-\u00a0for the marinade\nHalf of the Lebanese spice blend\nIceberg lettuce\u00a0-\u00a0shredded\nCherry tomatoes\u00a0-\u00a0quartered\nCucumber\u00a0-\u00a0halved and sliced\nPickled element of the salad\u00a0-\u00a0lacto-fermented cucumbers or red sauerkraut\nToum\u00a0-\u00a0Lebanese garlic sauce made of yoghurt, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice\nChilli sauce\nOptional: Drizzle of tahini sauce or a sprinkle of sumac for extra flavor\nHow to Prepare Chicken Shawarma:\nPrepare the chicken thighs by cutting each thigh into halves. Marinate the meat in a bowl with half the Lebanese spice blend, 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, and ginger. Allow the meat to marinate in the refrigerator for at least\n2 hours or overnight (up to 24 hours for optimal flavor)\n.\nOven Cooking: Skewer the marinated meat onto metal skewers and place them in a roasting dish. Preheat the oven to\n250\u00b0C\n. Grill the skewers for\n10-12 minutes\n, turning once halfway, until the meat is charred and cooked through.\nAlternative Cooking Method: If you don\u2019t have an oven or grill, you can cook the chicken in a cast-iron skillet on medium-high heat. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in the skillet and cook the chicken pieces in batches until well-charred and cooked through\n(about 6-8 minutes per side)\n. This method replicates the smoky effect of grilling.\nOnce the meat is fully cooked, remove it from the oven or skillet, take it off the skewers, and shred it with a knife.\nBuild your shawarma by layering the flatbread with meat juices, salad, shredded chicken, and sauces. For extra flavor, drizzle with tahini sauce or sprinkle sumac. Wrap it up, and for an authentic experience, use paper and tin foil.\nRecipe for Laffa flatbread & spice blend you can find here:\nChicken Shawarma Recipe - Chefs Binge"

Whatever you have will do, but I'd recommend one that's heavy on the meat and light on the tomatoes.\nRagu alla Ferrarese\nis my personal favourite.\nStep 1\nStart heating your oven to 200\u00b0C. While it's warming up, cut your aubergines in half.\nYou can leave the stems on, or cut them off, at your discretion.\nStep 2\nUsing\na small, sharp knife,\nroughly trace a border around the edges of the aubergines (just under half an inch thick).\nScore the flesh within that border to make it easier to scoop out and speed up the dicing process.\nThen scoop out the scored flesh with a metal spoon.\nStep 3\nAt this point, you have two options depending on how much time you have and how soft you like your aubergine:\nSprinkle salt on your aubergine shells and put them to the side.\nGarnish your aubergine shells with olive oil, salt and pepper, and put them in the oven for 10 minutes while you prepare the filling.\nStep 4\nWith your aubergine shells either cooking or resting, dice up the aubergine flesh, and cook in a small pan for 4-5 minutes with some oil, salt, pepper, garlic granules, and a little oregano.\nSoon enough, your aubergines (if you put them in the oven) will be ready to come out.\nDon't forget about them!\nStep 5\nOnce the diced aubergine has softened, add your rag\u00f9 to the pan and keep the heat on low for 2 minutes while you stir it through and combine it with the aubergine.\nStep 6\nNow for the fun part. Scoop the aubergine and rag\u00f9 mixture into your aubergine shells. Then pour on enough passata (around 3 tablespoons per aubergine half) to cover the filling.\nSlice your ball of mozzarella into fairly thick rounds\nand layer it on top of the passata.\nStep 7\nDrizzle with olive oil - paying extra attention to any exposed aubergine if your aubergine halves were not pre-cooked - and crack on some black pepper.\nStep 8\nPop your aubergine halves into\na small lasagna dish or baking dish with high sides\n, and cook uncovered for approximately 25 minutes.\nStep 9\nCarefully move your stuffed aubergine to a plate to cool for 5-10 minutes before serving. And you're done! Enjoy your rag\u00f9 stuffed aubergine on its own or with a simple salad."

This refreshing and simple salad is a staple in Polish cuisine, especially during the season when celeriac is at its best.

Wash and dice the apples.\nPlace the apples in a saucepan with 3 tablespoons of sugar and half a teaspoon of cinnamon.\nPlace the pan over medium heat and cook for a few minutes, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved. Stir the cornstarch into a small amount of cold water until smooth and add to the apples.\nStir well and cook the apples for a few minutes until the juice has thickened (the whole mixture should be sticky). Then remove from the heat and let the apples rest.\nSprinkle the thawed dough with a little flour and roll out to about 0.5 cm (0.2 inches) thick. Then cut out circles (I used a glass and a knife to do this).I had 2 sheets of ready-made puff pastry which made 16 circles (I also used the leftover dough after cutting). It is important that you get an even number of dough circles.\nMake small snowflake-shaped cuts on half of the dough circles (watch how I do it in the video).\nSpread 1 tablespoon of the apple filling on each of the remaining circles (the ones without the cuts). Cover with a circle of the scored dough, pressing the edges together a little with your fingers and then running a fork around the circle to create a nice scalloped edge.\nBrush the puffs with egg yolk and sprinkle with a little cane sugar (this will make the crust more golden).\nPut the puffs in a preheated oven at 175\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) for 15-20 minutes (convection mode). After that, take the puffs out of the oven and let them cool down. Enjoy!\nP.S. You can see the full recipe with step-by-step photos and video on my website\nyumchief.com\nor YouTube channel.

Put the chicken in a pan or bowl and cover.\nAdd a little more oil if the pan is dry, and reduce the heat to moderate (it's a good idea to lift the pan off for thirty seconds or so to let it cool to avoid scorching the spices)\nAdd the chilli flakes, oregano, and sage to the pan and heat for a few seconds until fragrant.\nCrumble over the stock cube and add a splash of hot water.\nAdd the gnocchi, tossing and stirring thoroughly untill all the pieces are glazed.\nAdd the single cream and stir gently until the gnocchi starts to absorb the liquid and the mixture thickens.\nGradually add milk, continuing to stir, until the sauce resembles a creamy soup and is bubbling, and the gnocchi has almost fully cooked.\nAdd the chicken and spinach to the pan, stir thoroughly to coat all the spinach, and continue to cook.\nLoosen the sauce with a little hot water as needed to keep it at a creamy soup consistency.\nOnce the spinach has wilted and the chicken just cooked through, quickly add the grated parmesan, stir, and add a final splash of hot water if needed. The sauce will continue to thicken after serving, so err on the side of keeping it loose.\nServe immediately.\nNotes:\nThe chicken is ready to serve when the chunks peel easily in two with a fork and the meat within is white, glossy, and steaming. It will quickly become chewy if left on the heat much beyond that point, so be ready to plate up!\nIf preparing a larger quantity, do the browning of the chicken in batches, and empty any liquid out of the pan into the bowl with the chicken between batches. If you try to cook too much at once, you'll get a lot of moisture buildup in the pan and the chicken will poach rather than browning. Once all the chicken is browned, tip the juices back into the pan with the spices and continue with the recipe.\nYou can prep and refrigerate the marinated raw chicken in advance for even more flavour."

Place ground beef in the skillet and break into smaller pieces as it cooks. Add seasoning to taste (I typically use seasoning salt). Cook until all pieces are brown (about 10 minutes).\nAdd another tablespoon of olive oil and then add the garlic and jalapeno and continue cooking, stirring frequently, until it's fragrant (about 1-2 minutes).\nStir in the rice, vegetable broth, beans, tomatoes, corn, chili powder, and cumin. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\nBring to a boil, then cover the skillet, reduce the heat to low, and let it simmer until the rice is cooked through (about 20 minutes).\nStir in the avocado, lime juice, and cilantro, if you're using it.\nServe and enjoy!\nNotes:\nInstead of adding lime juice, try enjoying this rice with \"Hint of lime\" Tostitos, if you can find them. It never disappoints!\nIf you're like me and make this for lunches throughout the week, it does keep pretty well in the fridge for several days (as long as it's in an airtight container) but it's always best to eat it within 1-3 days I'd say.\nTry adding some shredded Tex-Mex cheese and Frank's Red Hot to it (I add it each time I take a small portion for lunch and then reheat it). It adds a lot of flavor and the cheese makes it easier to eat especially if you're using tortilla chips."

Slice each cucumber in half lengthwise, then cut these halves into 5cm pieces. For added texture, you can further slice each segment into a triangular prism shape.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the cucumber segments with the julienned carrots and chives. Sprinkle the salt evenly over the vegetables, ensuring they are well-coated. This salting process draws out moisture, which is crucial for fermentation. Let the mixture rest for about\n25 minutes\n.\nWhile the cucumbers are resting, prepare the spicy Gochugaru paste. In a separate bowl, mix the Gochugaru (Korean chili flakes), minced garlic, minced ginger, grated red apple, sugar or honey, minced Saeujeot (Korean salted shrimp), and fish sauce. Adjust the chili flakes if you prefer a milder taste. Stir until you achieve a consistent paste.\nAfter the cucumbers have rested, gently squeeze out any excess moisture. Add the Gochugaru paste to the cucumber mixture, ensuring all pieces are evenly coated. Now, it's time to pack! You can use a traditional jar or opt for vacuum bags. Make sure to remove as much air as possible to promote proper fermentation.\nAllow the packed kimchi to ferment at room temperature for approximately 2 days. You'll notice a slight tangy aroma, indicating the fermentation process is underway.After this period, transfer the kimchi to the refrigerator to halt fermentation and preserve the cucumber's crunch. While the cucumber kimchi is ready to enjoy immediately after chilling, its flavors will continue to develop over the next few days. Since cucumbers are more delicate than cabbage, it\u2019s best to consume this kimchi while it retains its crispiness.\nBlog post:\nKorean Cucumber Kimchi"

Each sheet should be coated in the pesto and there should be enough sauce in the pan to just coat the bottom. If the mixture is dry, add a few spoonfuls of the reserved pasta cooking water.\nTop with additional cheese and serve immediately.\nNOTE: Makes 2 cups pesto enough for 2 to 3 pounds of pasta."

Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Working in batches, sear the tortillas until they\u2019re lightly browned and starting to crisp, for about 1 minute per side. Set the tortillas aside until you're ready to assemble the dish.\nIn a medium saucepan, bring the chicken broth, chiles guajillos, garlic, salt, oregano, and pepper to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover, and let sit until the chiles are soft, for 30 minutes. Transfer to a blender and puree until smooth.\nIn a large heavy pot over medium-high, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil. Cook the chicken thighs until deep golden brown, for 5 to 6 minutes. Turn the pieces over and brown the other side, for 5 to 6 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a plate. If there isn\u2019t at least 1 tablespoon of fat in the pot, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil along with the potatoes, carrots, and onion. Cook, tossing occasionally, until the vegetables are lightly browned, for 4 to 6 minutes.\nPour the chile puree into the pot with the vegetables; scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Nestle the chicken into the sauce and bring the mixture to a boil. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the chicken is completely tender and cooked through, for about 30 minutes.\nStir the vinegar into the pot and mound the chicken and vegetables on one side so there\u2019s room on the other side to dip the tortillas into the sauce.\nUsing tongs and working with one tortilla at a time, dip into the chile sauce, turning to coat, and cook in the sauce until softened, for about 3 seconds per side. Transfer the tortillas to a baking sheet as you go. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the queso fresco across the center of each tortilla and fold over like a taco.\nDivide the enchiladas among four plates and spoon more chile sauce over top. Top with lettuce, pickled onion, sour cream, cilantro and any remaining queso. Serve with the chicken, vegetables, remaining sauce, and pickled jalape\u00f1os."

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder until well combined.\nIn a large skillet over medium heat, add butter. Butter will melt and then brown in 5-15 minutes (very dependent on the brand of butter so watch carefully). Once you start to smell and see brown butter begin to form, swirl the butter around in the pan for even browning. Brown butter is ready when it\u2019s nut/mahogany brown.\nImmediately pour the butter into a large heat-safe bowl, scraping down the pan to scoop out any brown bits. Add the granulated and dark brown sugars. Stir.\nLet brown butter and sugar mixture cool for 10 minutes.\nAdd cold eggs and vanilla extract. Mix well.\nAdd the flour mixture to the butter mixture. Stir until just combined.\nFold in chocolate chips. Dough will be very soft and malleable.\nWhile you can chill your dough for up to an hour, there is absolutely no need to (I actually like the cookies just as much or more without chilling the dough). Scoop 2 tablespoon-sized balls on a parchment-lined or greased baking sheet about 2 inches apart. Tip: keep bowl with dough in the fridge between batches.\nBake cookies for 10-14 minutes until they are just set in the middle and light golden around the edges. Don\u2019t over-bake!\nSprinkle with flake salt if desired. Let cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely or enjoying warm!

Over medium heat, use a potato masher or a large spoon to cut up the meat into small crumbles while it cooks.\nOnce the meat is cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the pan, placing in a medium bowl.\nAdd the shallots and garlic to the pan and saut\u00e9 in the leftover sausage juices for 3-4 minutes until hot and fragrant.\nUse the slotted spoon to remove the shallots and garlic from the pan, placing in the bowl with the sausage.\nAdd parsley, thyme, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, ricotta, and salt and pepper to the bowl. Mix until well-combined.\nUse a teaspoon to stuff each mushroom. I like to add as much filling as possible, making sure to tightly pack the stuffing into each mushroom \u201ccup\u201d. If the filling isn\u2019t compact, some will fall out during the baking process!\nBake for 15-20 minutes until filling is hot. Let cool for at least 5 minutes before transferring to a plate to serve."

Place chicken breasts on a baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bake 17-22 minutes until chicken registers at least 165 degrees in the thickest part.\nLet chicken rest at room temperature for 5 minutes. Use a fork and knife to shred and pull apart chicken into bite-sized pieces.\nTransfer chicken to a bowl. Use paper towels to gently squeeze out extra juice, so that the chicken juices don\u2019t make the wraps soggy.\nToss buffalo sauce into the chicken. Set aside.\nAdd a small handful of lettuce to the middle of a tortilla, then use tongs to add a scoop of chicken.\nFinally, add 1-2 tablespoons of tomato, a sprinkle of onion, about 2 tablespoons of cheese, and 1-2 tablespoons of dressing. Finish with a drizzle more of buffalo sauce if desired. Don\u2019t overstuff your wrap or you won\u2019t be able to close it! Exact quantities of each ingredient depend on your preference.\nMaking sure the fillings are in the center of the wrap, fold in the sides of the tortilla over the filling. Fold up the bottom edge of the tortilla over the filling, holding the sides in place. Rolling the wrap away from you, tuck the filling in as you go. Aim for a tight roll, but not so tight that it tears the tortilla. Fold the side flaps inward before you finish rolling. See the video below for visual instructions! Repeat for other wraps. Enjoy!"

Rub this spice blend evenly on the meat-side only, plus the sides of the pork belly.\nFlip the pork belly over to the skin-side. Try to not get spices on the skin! Use paper towels to pat dry the skin as best as possible.\nWith a sharp knife, score (poke) the skin. Do NOT go too deep, into the meat. These poke marks should be about \u00bd-inch apart.\nRub \u00bd tablespoon salt evenly on the skin.\nPlace a large piece of foil underneath the pork belly, meat-side down touching the foil. Wrap the foil up the sides of the pork belly, tightly wrapping around it like a foil boat. Foil should come up the sides without touching the top of the pork belly (the skin).\nPlace pork belly in the foil boat, on a baking sheet. Let chill in the fridge, uncovered, for 2 hours.\nPreheat the oven to 375\u2109. Mix together oil and vinegar. Use a basting brush to brush the skin with this mixture. It will look like too much, but use it all!\nRoast pork in the foil boat on a baking sheet for 55-70 minutes. Foil boat will peel away from the pork belly as it roasts. The center of a meat layer (not fat layer) should register at least 165 degrees. It\u2019s okay if the temperature is a bit over.\nRemove pork belly from the oven, turn oven off, and leave oven door open for 5 minutes to let oven cool. This ensures oven broiler will work correctly.\nTurn broiler on (I use low setting if you have one). Place pork belly back in the oven and let broil for 5-15 minutes until skin is crispy. Watch carefully! Pork belly skin will pop and crackle, crisping up. Rotate pork belly if needed, to ensure even crackling. If there\u2019s a spot that\u2019s burning, cover with a little piece of foil.\nLet rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving with hoisin or your favorite dipping sauce."

Place salmon in a dry baking dish and bake for 14-18 minutes until the center starts to flake, or the internal temperature reaches 135-145\u2109.\nWhile salmon is in the oven, grate a yellow onion with the coarse setting of a cheese grater. The grated onion will look like watery apple sauce. Add grated yellow onion, panko, bell pepper, garlic, egg, chives, parsley, and salt and pepper to a medium bowl.\nWhen salmon is done, transfer to a plate and use two forks to shred salmon into little pieces. After it cools for a few minutes (so egg doesn\u2019t scramble), add salmon to the bowl with other ingredients. Mix until well-combined.\nUse a \u00bc cup measure to make \u00bc cup-sized balls, placing them on a large plate or baking sheet. You should be able to make roughly 11 balls.\nOnce the balls are formed, lightly push the balls down to make thick patties. Ensure the ingredients are tightly packed/squeezed together so the patties don\u2019t fall apart.\nAdd \u00bd inch of oil to a large pan. Turn heat to medium-high and wait until the oil registers 325-350\u2109\nOnce the oil has reached temperature, very carefully slide croquettes into the pan (using a spatula), ensuring they don\u2019t break apart. You can add as many as possible without overcrowding. Cook croquettes for 1-2 minutes per side until deep golden. If you turn the croquettes prematurely, they\u2019ll fall apart.\nUse a slotted spatula to remove the croquettes from the oil, placing on a paper towel lined plate. Sprinkle generously with salt.\nRepeat until all croquettes are fried. Serve with lemon wedges."

Seeds and stems removed.\n1/2 pound dried black beans\n2-3 pounds of ground beef in 2 packages.\n1 pound stew meat\n1 29 oz. can tomato sauce\n3-4 tablespoons chili powder\n1 tablespoon cumin\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\nseveral pinches of mexican oregano\n2 quarts beef stock\n1 quart chicken stock\n1 bottle of beer\nsalt and msg to taste\ncilantro\nCayenne powder\nValentina hot sauce\nSteps:\nSoak beans in cold, unsalted water overnight\nDrain and rinse beans\nCover beans with beef stock. Bring to boil then reduce to simmer. When liquid level gets too low, add water and keep at a simmer.\nPut one onion (quartered), both stalks of celery, 1 carrot (or half a large carrot), the poblano, one of the jalapenos, half the red bell pepper, several cloves of garlic, and the mushrooms on a roasting sheet and put in the oven on 400 degrees for about 30 minutes. The skin on the poblano and jalapeno should be charred and blistered and there should be light charring on the onion.\nRemove skin, stems and seeds from the poblano and jalapeno.\nAdd all the roasted ingredients (poblano, jalapeno, half the bell pepper, garlic, carrot, celery, and mushrooms, ) to a food processor or sturdy blender and blend to a fine paste.\nIn a large saute pan, over medium heat, add some olive oil and the roasted vegetable paste. Add salt. Allow the moisture to cook out of the \"mirepoix\" and the paste to get a deep brown. Stir regularly. Allow around 20 minutes to get a really good depth of color.\nAdd one package of ground beef to pan, mix well with the mirepoix mixture and break it up thoroughly. Add salt and some chili powder. Let the moisture cook off and the meat to get a deep brown. This may take another 20-30 minutes. Stir frequently.\nMeanwhile, toast the dried chilis briefly in a hot pan, be careful not to burn them. Transfer to a small pot, cover with chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Allow them to simmer 10-20 minutes then remove from heat and set aside.\nDice the other onion into large dices. Dice the remaining bell pepper. Cut the carrot into small circles (like in a classic beef stew). Cut the remaining jalapeno and the serranos similarly. Slice the remaining garlic into thin slices.\nIn a large stock pot, add some oil, and\nhalf\nof the diced onions. Use medium heat. Allow them to soften and just begin to get some color, then take the remaining ground beef and drop into the stock pot in large chunks. Add salt and 1-2 tablespoons of chili powder, as well as some cumin. Cover and let the large chunks of ground beef to cook until light brown. Pour off some of the grease.\nAdd the dried chilis as well as the stock they simmered in to the food processor or blender and process until a smooth paste or liquid. Taste for heat level. Remember, it will be diluted a lot by the rest of the ingredients, so don't be afraid of a bit of kick.\nAdd the meat and mirepoix mixture to the stock pot, along with the beans and their cooking liquid, and the mixture of dried chilis from the food processor. Add the beer and tomato sauce and bring to simmer. Mix well.\nSear the stew meat in the saute pan just long enough to get some color, then add to the stock pot.\nBrown your remaining veggie ingredients (the last of the onion, the carrots, bell pepper and jalapeno/serranos and garlic). Add them to the stock pot.\nAdd garlic powder, cumin, mexican oregano and remaining chili powder to stock pot.\nTaste and add salt, MSG, cayenne powder and hot sauce to taste and preferred heat level.\nCover. Let simmer 1-3 hours (the longer the better). Add beef stock or beer if more liquid is needed. Taste frequently and adjust with additional salt and chili powder as needed.\nIn last 5-10 minutes of cooking, add your fresh cilantro.\nServe with shredded cheddar cheese, cotija cheese and fritos scoops (or your preferred chili toppings).\n*Adjust for spiciness by leaving out the serranos, cayenne powder and hot sauce. If you leave out the hot sauce, add a bit of lime juice for acidity. Try not to reduce the dried chilis or chili powder, as they are an essential part of the flavor.\n**To remove the seeds from your dried chilis in the most efficient way possible, use a pair of scissors to cut the top off with the stem, and then cut long ways down the chili. Then just run your finger along the inside to remove the seeds."

Let them fry for a couple minutes.\nAdd chicken to oil along with the chicken bones. Let it fry until outside is just beginning to brown and moisture has cooked out of chicken and evaporated, leaving only oil.\nDrain some of the oil if desired.\nAdd sauce and stir together, continuing to fry chicken.\nReduce heat and let remaining oil cool slightly before adding boiling water to chicken. Add enough to just barely cover chicken, with some of the chicken sticking above the surface.\nReturn to boil, then reduce to simmer. Cover.\nAdd chiles (dried and fresh), pepper, onion and garlic.\nLet simmer 20 minutes, then remove cover and reduce sauce.\n*A few ingredients used in one or more of the traditional recipes I referenced were not available in my location. \"Screw\" chiles, \"millet\" chiles, and angelica. I've left out or made substitions. The dish is typically made with an entire rooster, but that would make way too much for my partner and I so I've used two chicken thighs and a breast instead."

Let your pork rest at room temperature for 20 minutes before grilling.\nMarinate pork, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. I recommend marinating your pork tenderloin right before grilling. The tenderloin is very \u201cporous\u201d so it soaks up the marinade quickly.\nPreheat grill to high heat.\nGrill the pork tenderloin for about 4 minutes a side (4 sides total). Before grilling the final side, check the temperature of the thickest part of the tenderloin to see how close it is to 145\u00b0F (done temperature). Grill pork for 0 to 6 more minutes to reach an internal temperature of 145\u00b0F (depends on thickness of pork). Total grill time is 12-18 minutes.\nLet tenderloin rest for 10 minutes before slicing against the grain (perpendicular to the muscle fibers) with a sharp chef\u2019s knife."

Start with a cold wok, to let the fat render out. When the meat is crispy, take it out, but leave the fat on the bottom.\nWhisk the eggs with the grated parmigiano.\ncut the garlic in brunoise and the white part of the green onions in rings of 2mm of thickness.\nadd the anchovies and the garlic to the wok on a very low flame and let them infuse in the fat. Grate some fresh black pepper and let it bloom with the garlic and anchovies for no more than 2 minutes (otherwhise it will get bitter). Then add the white part of the green onion and cook at low flame for about 3-4 minutes.\nAdd the eggs and parmigiano mixture and cook it briefly until half way scrambled. Then add the rice and put the flame to maximum. Separate the rice (you don't want any chunks) and stir vigorously until the rice and the eggs are cooked through.\nWhen everything is cooked through, turn the heat off and add the green part of the green onions and stir them in.\nGrate some extra black pepper and serve sprinkling some more green onions on top.\nPS: I recommend to NOT use any soy sauce, since parmigiano and anchovies are naturally umami (parmigiano contains MSG)."

On a baking sheet, mix together coconut and panko. Spread out in a single layer.\nToast for 4-6 minutes, tossing halfway through, until golden. Watch carefully! The outer coconut and panko will toast faster than the middle. Once out of the oven, season with salt and pepper, and toss again to distribute the toastier pieces. Set aside.\nThaw shrimp by placing them in a colander under cold running water for about 10 minutes, or until thawed. Alternatively, you can soak them in a big bowl of cold water for 20 minutes, dumping out the water and refilling halfway through.\nOnce thawed, pat the shrimp dry as best as possible.\nCreate an assembly line: the shrimp, then a bowl of flour, then a bowl of beaten eggs, then the coconut mixture, and then another baking sheet that\u2019s lightly greased or lined with parchment paper.\nTake 1 shrimp at a time: dip whole shrimp (but no tail if there is one) in flour and shake off the excess, dip whole shrimp (no tail) in egg and tap off the excess, and then dunk the shrimp in the coconut mixture pressing as much as possible on there. Place coated shrimp on the baking sheet.\nContinue this process for all of the shrimp, placing them in a single layer (not touching each other) on the baking sheet. Tip: if you\u2019re worried about knowing when the shrimp is cooked through, place 1 shrimp without breading on the baking sheet so you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s pink!\nBake at 400\u2109 for 10 minutes (no need to flip), or until the shrimp itself is pink and the tails curl in a bit.

So wash your lettuce, cut your cucumber, julienne your carrot and cook the rice vermicelli noodles according to the package instructions. rinse under cold water and set all the ingredients to the side. Now it is time to boil your shrimp in soft boiling water for two minutes, then immediately cool them down in some ice water. I also like to cut them from tail to head down the middle, so you have a more even dispersion and this looks more beautiful in the end result. This is also the time to prepare your dipping sauce(s). For both recipes you only have to combine all the ingredients together!\nNow it's time to roll! Start by soaking a rice wrapper in cold water for maximum 10 seconds and lay down on a flat and clean surface. Add your filling on top of the wrapper with enough space to the borders and start closing up your spring roll (you can find an\ninstruction video here\n). Finish all of them and serve them with you favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!"

        "top_comment": "\u00c9touff\u00e9e is a dish found in both Cajun and Creole cuisine typically served with shellfish over rice. The dish employs a technique known as smothering, a popular method of cooking in the Cajun and Creole areas of southwest Louisiana. Wikipedia\nMake pic on Imgur\nCrawfish \u00c9touff\u00e9e\nIngredients\n1 lb Crawfish Tails\n8 tbsp Flour\n8 tbsp Butter\n1 cup diced Celery\n1 cup diced Bell Pepper\n1 cup diced Onion\n2 tbsp minced Garlic\n1 tbsp fresh Thyme\n1 tbsp fresh Parsley\n1 tsp Cajun Spice Blend\n1/2 tsp fresh Black Pepper\n1/2 tsp Salt\n3 cups Chicken Broth with crawfish/veg scraps\n2-4 cups prepared Jasmine Rice\nThe Cajun Spice Blend\n3 Tbsp Paprika\n2 Tbsp Garlic\n1 Tbsp Sea Salt\n1 Tbsp Onion\n1 Tbsp Black Pepper\n\u00bd Tbsp White Pepper\n\u00bd Tbsp Oregano\n1 tsp Cayenne\n\u00bd Tbsp Thyme\nInstructions\nGrind the spices for the spice blend or use store bought. If using store bought don't remove the fresh thyme and parsley.\nStart a pot for broth. Simmer chicken broth and the crawfish heads/peels, onion scraps and a little of the celery scraps. Set aside at least 3 cups.\nCook rice per package instructions. I use a rice cooker at 1 part rice to 1.5 parts water.\nIn a heavy pan like a Dutch oven heat butter until bubbles stop and stir in flour. Stir for 5-10 minutes until color is blond. Light peanut butter is okay but  dark roux is not used for \u00c9touff\u00e9e. See tips.\nAdd the trinity onion, celery, and bell peppers and cook until celery is tender.\nAdd aromatics: fresh herbs, spices and garlic\nAdd 2-3 cups of broth and simmer for 30 minutes.\nAdd crawfish tails and heat through. They're already cooked.\nPlate with rice and garnish with parsley and green onion. Serve with warm crusty bread.\nTip: The best tails are those saved from a crawfish boil. If using store bought get the pre-peeled tails not the frozen whole crawfish.\nTip: Sub the crawfish for shrimp. Never tried but I bet seared chicken chunks would be fine. Lump crab is always welcome.\nTip: For a more Creole style add some diced tomato to the simmer step and a Creole spice blend rather than the Cajun.\nTip: Roux requires constant attention. Never walk away from a roux. If you see small black specks consider starting over as the roux will be bitter.\nTip: Sub the roux butter for a nice vegetable oil in the same amount."

Making use of a curry paste for a marinade is a real shortcut to a flavor-packed BBQ-dish!\nFull recipe:\nhttps://misterspiceguy.com/recipe/thai-green-curry-chicken-satay\nIngredients for chicken satay:\n3 tbsp homemade green curry paste (or any other curry paste)\n1 tbsp vegetable oil\n500g chicken fillet or thighs, cut into thin strips\n1 tbsp palm sugar\n1 tbsp fish sauce (nam pla)\n150 ml coconut milk\n2 tbsp lime juice\u200d\nIngredients for satay sauce:\n1 heaped tbsp of green curry paste\n1 tbsp of vegetable oil\n2 tbsp of peanut butter (preferably crunchy)\n4 tbsp of roasted peanuts, coarsely ground/chopped\n150 ml coconut milk\n1 tsp fish sauce\n1 tbsp palm/regular sugar\nDirections:\n\u200dThe first step will be cutting up your chicken thighs in chunks of your preference. I personally like to make the cubes approximately 1cm x 1cm, because I don't like to grill the satay for to long. Most important is that you are consistent in the cutting size, so that your satay will cook evenly. Then put all the other satay ingredients in a bowl and give a whisk, add your chicken and put in the fridge for at least one hour but ideally overnight. If you are using wooden skewers, make sure you soak them in water to prevent burning on the BBQ.\n\u200dNow it's time to make the peanut-satay sauce. Start by heating up the vegetable oil in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Fry your curry paste for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. Then add all the other sauce ingredients and make sure you put it on your smallest burner on a real low heat. slowly simmer the sauce for about 5 minutes and your satay sauce will be finished. If you cook your satay sauce too long or on a high heat you will see that al the oil from the peanuts and the coconut milk separate and start floating on top, that is not what we are aiming for!\n\u200dSkew your chicken satay on the soaked skewers and now it's time to grill the satay. Ideally we do this on a BBQ but sometimes you want to make this dish in winter or you don't want to start a fire. In this case you can also use a griddle pan. Grill your satays on a medium-high heat and make sure you keep turning them often. After about 5 minutes of grilling (depending on your chunk size) your chicken satay will be ready to eat. Serve with the peanut sauce. Enjoy!"

Use vegetarian kimchi. Blend up the tofu and mushrooms so they're somewhere between crumbly and smooth (if it's too smooth, the texture gets weird)\n**Directions**\nLay out wrappers on a large plate or cutting board.\nGrab a spoonful of filling and spread thinly and evenly over wrappers.\nPan fry with some oil over medium heat for 2-3 minutes on each side."

To the first dish, add flour, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. To the second dish, add 2 eggs plus 2 tablespoons of hot sauce and whisk until smooth. Add panko with a pinch of salt and pepper to the third dish.\nPreheat the oil:\nAdd about \u00bc inch of neutral oil to a wide pot or skillet. You only need enough oil to come up to half the thickness of a chicken tender. Turn the heat to medium-low to preheat the oil.\nDredge the chicken:\nDip a chicken tenderloin into the flour and shake off the excess. Next, dip it into the egg mixture and shake off the excess.

Continue until all tenders are dredged.\nHeat the sauce:\nSimmer the remaining 1 cup of hot sauce over low heat as you fry the chicken tenders.\nFry the chicken tenders:\nTurn the heat on the oil to medium. If you drop a piece of panko into the pot, it should bubble and sizzle but not overly vigorously. You can use a meat thermometer to ensure it is 350\u00baF.\nOnce the oil is hot, fry the chicken tenders in batches, about 4-5 minutes per side, until golden brown. Once the tenders reach 165\u00baF, transfer them to a cooling rack or paper towel-lined plate.\nSauce the tenders:\nOnce all the chicken tenders are fried, pour the warm sauce into a large bowl.\nAdd the chicken tenders to the bowl in batches and toss gently to coat in the sauce.\nTo serve:\nTransfer the sauced tenders to a serving platter and sprinkle with minced scallions.

Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then loosen the cake by tapping it against the counter. Invert the cake onto a serving platter.\nMAKE THE LEMON GLAZE:\nStir together lemon glaze ingredients (lemon juice & sugar - if needed, heat them briefly to help dissolve the sugar). Brush on the hot cake until all of the glaze is absorbed (you may not end up using all of the glaze).\nMAKE LEMON ICING & SERVE:\nwhisk together the icing ingredients (powdered sugar & lemon juice), adjusting the lemon juice amount to make the icing fairly thick but pourable, however not too runny. If the icing is close to the thickness you want, but still a touch too thick to pour, warm it slightly and it will become more fluid when it cools off (perfect for icing the bundt cake). Drizzle the icing over the top of the bundt cake and serve when the icing sets."

        "top_comment": "My thoughts, adjustments, struggles, recommendations and what id change next time.\nThis was my first Wellington, cooking and eating. It was absolutely delicious. I definitely cried a little while eating it, I'm not sure if it was because I was fucking exhausted by the end or it was just that good.  Maybe both.\nThe Serious Eats recipe was fool proof. I looked up about a dozen video recipes and a few blog recipes and compared the ingredients, methods of cooking and oven temp. I found some recipes using lower oven temps didn't have the right cook on the puff pastry and recipes using high oven temps (450f) relied heavily on resting the meat for 30 min or more for carry over cooking, and without an oven safe probe thermometer, I wasnt willing to risk it. I cooked it at 425f. I didn't like the idea of giving myself more work so instead of making crepes to combat leaking as other recipes so seeing this recipe use premade phyllo dough was great. I also did NOT make my own puff pastry but did go out of my way to purchase an all butter puff pastry, which happened to be from Trader Joes and was made in France. I\nabsolutely\nimplore those wanting to make a wellington not to use Pillsbury puff pastry. The Trader Joes puff pastry was the best damn thing I've tasted. Unfortunately it is seasonal at TJs but there are other stores that sell all butter puff pastry year round. I skipped the soy sauce but used worcestershire instead and used Macallan 12 year since its what we had on hand for the duxelles. I used Portugese Flor de Sal instead of French, but the important thing was that it was a big crunchy salt. I did not use chives.\nI omitted using Foie Gras because I both didn't want to spend more on an already expensive dish and I thought it would be just too rich against already rich flavors. In my opinion, I felt I was right. I took it out of the oven at an internal temp of 118 but it continued cooking to 130ish after sitting for 10-15 min. I recommend taking it from the oven around 110 and letting it sit. This was important to me because I was only cooking for two and heating our leftovers overcooked the meat a little, but there was no avoiding it.\nI forgot to weigh my center cut tenderloin after butchering/trimming so I think it was closer to 3 lbs. This was only an issue since that meant I didnt have as much of the duxelles as I would have wished. I also used a spicy german dijon style mustard from L\u00f6wensenf and I definitely recommend a very spicy and flavorful mustard, it stood out very nicely amongst the other flavors and I feel like I would have missed it if I had used a less spicy one.\nAlthough not in the Serious Eats recipe, I did consider making a peppercorn pan sauce but got too tired. Fresh from the oven it was very moist and we agreed it didn't need it, however eating the leftovers heated in the oven definitely sacrificed some of that and it could have benefited from a sauce.\nI would definitely make this again, but would do most of the prep a day or more in advance. Resting the meat was necessary at various stages and that really helps with the shaping of the meat. I would make more duxelle and a higher quality prosciutto. I would also take it from the oven earlier to keep it closer to rare/medium rare."

Then peel your sweet potatoes and cut them into even-sized cubes. Add to a pan, together with 75 ml of water, 50 grams of butter, and a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer and turn low. Let this simmer for about 25 minutes.\nIn the meantime, it is time to prepare the sauce. Finely chop the shallot and saute for 2 minutes on medium heat. Add your stock and port wine and reduce by half or until the reduction thickens. Set this aside, clean your mushrooms and finely chop your garlic. Heat your frying pan and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Fry your sage leaves in the oil for about 20-30 seconds or until crispy and put them on a piece of kitchen paper.\nNow we are getting there! Preheat your oven to 160 degrees Celsius. Score the fat side of the duck breast (but not too deep) and add it to the already hot pan with the fat side down. Make sure your pan is on medium heat and let the fat render for about 5 minutes or until evenly golden and crispy. Then turn over the duck breast, add a small knob of butter to the pan, and baste your duck for two more minutes. Now add this to an oven dish and continue cooking for about 8 more minutes or until a core temperature of 53 degrees Celsius.\nIn the meantime, we fry our mushrooms with half of the garlic and a bit of olive oil until nicely golden, add them to an ovenproof dish, and put them in the oven next to the duck. Now add some olive oil the rest of the garlic and your spinach to the pan. Saute until it is fragrant and welted down and set aside. Now you mash your sweet potatoes with a tbsp of cream and salt and pepper to taste. Since we used only a little bit of water, we didn't have to drain them before mashing them to create the ultimate texture and flavor. reheat your port reduction and cut off the heat again, add 50 grams of cold butter and combine with a whisk.\nAfter your duck hits 53 degrees Celsius you let it rest on your counter for about 10 minutes and then we are ready to plate the dish. Start with a layer of your potato puree and add the spinach and mushrooms on top. Slice your duck into 6 pieces and add 3 pieces to both plates (like in the picture). Finish with the sauce and crispy sage leaves and your dish is finished. Enjoy! \ud83c\udf84"

First clean and rough-chop your vegetables. Add the fishbones and all the vegetables to a large pot and cover with about two liters of water, bring to a simmer and let this simmer on low heat for about 30-40 minutes. In the meantime skim any foam off the pan to create a nice and clear broth. After this 30 minutes simmer, we are going to strain the stock in another pot and put it back on medium-high heat, and continue till the stock is reduced to \u2153 of what you started with.\nNow it is time to prepare the sauce. finely chop the shallot and sautee for 2 minutes on medium heat. add 200 ml of white wine and 200 ml of your already reduced stock. let this simmer until reduced by half and then strain out the onions and add your reduction back to the pan. Set this aside for now.\nFill a small pan with water and bring to a boil. Then blanch your asparagus for about two minutes. Drain them and cool them down with cold water. Slice your bacon/zeeuws spek in thick slices and trim them until they almost have the size of a scallop.\nNow it\u2019s time to finish the dish. Put your saucepan on low heat with your reduction. Start with frying your bacon in a dry pan on medium heat until crispy golden brown. let them drain on a piece of kitchen paper and then sear your scallops for two minutes on the first side, so they turn nicely golden brown. On the other side I usually sear a little bit shorter because you don\u2019t want to overcook them; about 60-90 seconds.\nFinish the sauce by adding the cream to your warm reduction and simmer for 30 seconds. then turn off the heat and add your cubed cold butter in small batches while whisking and incorporating the butter in the sauce. serve the scallops and bacon on the asparagus. Add the beurre blanc sauce and the chives and flowers as garnish. Enjoy!"

Squeeze in the juice of one lime and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover the pan back with a lid and let it rest for 5 minutes.\nSprinkle the paella with chopped parsley for a fresh finish.

This dish is a cherished winter favorite, traditionally prepared for Christmas and perfectly complemented by Polish Beetroot Soup, known as Barszcz Czerwony. Enjoy the rich flavors and hearty warmth it brings. Smacznego!\nRead more about the recipe:\nPolish Krokiety - Chefs Binge\nThis recipe makes 10 Croquettes\n\u200b\nIngredients for 10 Pancakes:\n* 2.5 cups All-purpose flour - (300g) Plain Flour\n* 1.7 cups Milk - (400ml)\n* 0.8 cups Water - (200ml)\n* 2 Eggs\n* 1 pinch Salt\n* Vegetable oil - for frying\n\u200b\nIngredients for the filling:\n* 10.6 oz White mushrooms - (300g)\n* 3.5 oz Dried wild mushrooms - (100g) Porcini and Boletus\n* 1.7 lbs Sauerkraut with liquid - (800g)\n* 3 Onions, medium-size - diced\n* 3 Bay leaves\n* 5 All Spice Berries\n* 1 tsp Sugar\n* 1 tsp Vegeta seasoning - you can use salt instead\n* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil\n* Salt and Pepper to taste\n\u200b\nIngredients for panee:\n* 2 Eggs\n* 2 cups Breadcrumbs - (200g)\n\u200b\nInstructions:\nCooking Sauerkraut:\nPlace sauerkraut with the juice in a pot and add enough water to cover it. Include bay leaves and allspice berries. Simmer on low heat until softened, approximately 3-4 hours. Add more liquid as necessary to keep the sauerkraut submerged.\nPreparing Mushrooms:\nPlace dried wild mushrooms in a glass jug or a small pot. Pour boiling water over them to cover. After 15 minutes, when they are soft, remove and chop them. Reserve the mushroom water for later use, being careful to avoid any sand at the bottom.\nFrying Onions and Mushrooms:\nIn a frying pan over medium heat, fry onions until they soften but do not brown, about 5 minutes. Then add sliced white mushrooms, increase the heat, and cook until the mushrooms start to brown. Season with Vegeta and black pepper to taste, then remove from the stove.\nMaking Pancakes:\nBlend all pancake ingredients until a smooth batter forms. Cook pancakes on a medium-sized non-stick frying pan. Pour a small amount of batter into the hot, oiled pan and spread it around by swirling. Once the pancake is set, remove it and place it on a plate. Repeat until all pancakes are made.\nCombining Filling Ingredients:\nOnce the cabbage is cooked, strain it from the liquid and remove the spices. Let it cool enough to handle, then chop finely. Mix with both the re-hydrated and fried mushrooms and onions. Season with sugar, black pepper, and salt to taste.\nRolling Krokiety:\nSpread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.\nCoating Krokiety:\nWhisk 2 eggs in a bowl. Dip each krokiet in the egg, then coat with breadcrumbs. Prepared krokiety can be refrigerated for up to three days before frying if needed.\nPreparing for Frying:\nSpread about 2 tablespoons of filling inside each pancake. Fold the left and right sides inward, then roll up the pancake.\nFrying Krokiety:\nShallow fry the krokiety in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry for about 3 minutes on each side, using enough oil to cook the sides of the krokiet.\nServe the krokiety with Polish beetroot soup (\"Barszcz\") or enjoy them on their own. Smacznego!"

You may need more depending on the size of the carcass. Try your best to immerse the bird with water, but if your pot isn\u2019t big enough, it\u2019s ok if the back bone sticks out a bit. Add a big pinch of salt to the water.\nBring to a boil and then simmer for 2-3 hours. You may wish to flip the bird once during simmering. The liquid should reduce by almost half.\nCover the pot (with foil, if the turkey is sticking out) and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.\nThe next day, remove the carcass from the stock. Pick off any remaining meat and set it aside in a bowl to be added to the soup. Discard the carcass.\nIf the stock is very gelatinous, place it on the heat over medium-high just until the gelatin melts, and the stock returns to a liquid. Turn off the heat and strain through a fine-mesh sieve.\nGive the pot a quick rinse and wipe it out. Return it to the stovetop.\nCook the soup aromatics:\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for 8-10 minutes.\nAdd the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the bundle of thyme.\nSimmer the soup:\nPour in the prepared stock and the chopped turkey. Add salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme.\nFinish the soup:\nReturn the soup to a boil. Add the pastina and cook for 3-4 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper.\nFinish the soup by adding parsley, fennel fronds, and lemon juice.\nTo serve:\nLadle the soup into bowls and serve with lemon wedges and minced parsley on the side.

If using freshly cooked rice, spread it out on a tray to cool slightly. If you are using leftover rice - that's even better - break up any clumps.\nCut the leek in half and slice into rings of 1 cm. Dice the carrot, and cut the pointed cabbage and onion. If you use other vegetables, or left-over vegetables, cut them in bite-sized pieces as well. You can basically use any vegetable you like.\nGather the spices: turmeric, ginger, cilantro, cumin, garlic. Chop the shrimp paste, this is optionally. And grab your sambal.\nHeat a large pan or wok over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of neutral oil and saut\u00e9 the onion until fragrant and translucent.\nTurn your wok down to low heat. Add the spices, the shrimp paste and the sambal to the wok. If using sambal, adjust the amount according to your desired level of spiciness. Wok for 3 minutes.\nAdd the vegetables to the wok. Heat your wok over medium heat. Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables are slightly softened.\nAdd 1/3 of the cooked rice to the wok. And then add the kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce). Use a spatula to break up any clumps and mix the rice with the vegetables and spices.\nAdd the other 2/3 of the cooked rice and the chopped celery leaves. Continue stir-frying the rice for about 5 more minutes until all the rice has turned brown and yellowish. Optionally you can now make a sunny side up egg in another pan. I really like a sunny side up egg as a condiment to this nasi goreng recipe.\nRemove your nasi goreng from heat and serve on the plate with condiments such as: prawn crackers, store-bought atjar tjampoer (mixed pickled vegetables), sambal (Indonesian chili sauce), and your sunny side up egg.Selamat makan!

Remove from the oven and prepare the pecan topping and apple filling.\nApple Filling\nPeel and core 6 firm, sweet, and tart apples. Cut each apple in half.\nUsing a sharp knife or mandolin, cut apple halves into thin slices. Sprinkle with lemon juice to prevent browning.\nIn a large bowl, combine apples with flour, cinnamon, maple syrup, and salt. Mix until evenly combined. Pour apples and their juices over baked shortbread crust.\nApple Crisp Topping\nIn a medium bowl, combine flour, oats, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Add butter and mix together with your hands. Mixture will resemble clay clumps. Add roughly chopped pecans and mix together one final time. Sprinkle over apple layer.\nBake apple crisp at 350F (325F convection oven) for 60-70 minutes. You will know when this apple crisp is done by taking it out of the oven and sticking a knife into the centre. If the knife goes into the apples easily with few crunches and some soft patches, it is done. Start checking readiness at 60 min, and check every 5 min thereafter.\nAllow apple crisp bars to cool in pan, slice, and enjoy!\nEdit: ingredients list"

Blend until smooth. This unique blend will serve as the creamy base for your curry.\n2.\nIn a large saucepan or wok, heat a bit of oil over medium heat. Add the red curry paste and fry for a minute or two until it becomes aromatic. This step is crucial for releasing the flavors of the curry.\n3.\nPour the blended fish-coconut mixture into the saucepan with the curry paste. Mix well to ensure the curry paste is evenly distributed.\n4.\nAdd the second can of coconut cream to the saucepan and stir well. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce will begin to thicken and the flavors will meld together.\n5.\nAdd the diced potatoes and sliced carrots to the simmering sauce. Cover and let it simmer for approximately 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\n6.\nOnce the vegetables are cooked, add the king prawns to the curry. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the prawns are pink and fully cooked. Be cautious not to overcook them.\n7.\nFold in a handful of fresh spinach right before you're ready to serve. The residual heat will wilt the spinach without overcooking it.\n8.\nTaste and adjust the seasoning of your curry. You might want to add salt, a splash of lime juice for a tangy kick, and a little fish sauce for extra umami. If to thick adjust with a little bit of water.\n9.\nGarnish with fresh coriander if desired, and serve your Thai-style fish and prawn curry while it's warm. It pairs beautifully with rice vermicelli noodles for a complete meal, offering a delightful texture contrast to the creamy curry. Enjoy !"

If you make it as-is, be sure you're salting throughout and salting well so it has enough flavor! Particularly if you use water.\nIf you don't keep vegan, you can add bacon or even crumbled Italian sausage and finish with Parmesan cheese for a richer, heartier dish.\nIf you keep vegan and want to pump it up, finish with grated plant-based Parm. You can also add more veggies to this. I think it would be great with fried mushrooms cooked before the onion and added back in with the broth/water.\nIngredients:\n1 tablespoon neutral oil for frying\n1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n2 (15-ounce) cans white beans, drained and rinsed, or 3 cups fully cooked white beans from 1 cup dry white beans\nSalt, pepper, and crushed red pepper to taste\n6 cups water or vegetable stock\n8 ounces elbow pasta or your favorite small pasta like ditalini or orzo 1 head Lacinato kale, stems removed and leaves torn\n1 cup loosely packed fresh herbs such as basil, parsley, dill, or a mix; roughly chopped; a pinch reserved for garnish\nSaut\u00e9 the onion and beans:\nHeat the neutral oil in a wide pot on medium-high.

Reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Taste and season periodically.\nCook the pasta:\nMeanwhile, bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to package instructions, then drain. Set aside.\nFinish the soup:\nAdd the kale and fresh herbs to the pot of beans and simmer for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.

(Careful not to over-season).\nWhile soup is simmering, slice baguette and drizzle with olive oil and garlic powder and toast in the oven at 270 for 10 minutes or until toasted. Shred cheeses and make a 3 to 1 blend of gruyere and mozzarella.\nLadle soup into bowl, add 3 to 4 slices of baguette and add a generous amount of shredded cheese blend to the top, making sure it covers the entire portion of bread and soup and is almost spilling over the sides.\nPut bowls into broiler for 1 to 2 minutes OR use a hand torch to melt the cheese until it is sizzling au gratin. Let cool down for 5 minutes. Garnish with chives and serve.\nThis recipe is one I developed from trial and error because I wanted to make the best possible version of this classic soup. No flour, no sugar added, the only sweetness is from the onions which become extremely soft and caramelized braising slowly in the oven. Also, using homemade stock is highly recommended.

Add the short ribs in an even layer and cook without moving for 3 minutes. Flip and cook an additional 2-3 minutes per side until browned all over. Remove from the pot. Turn the heat to medium.\nAdd the garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and, using the back of your spoon, gently press the paste into any browned bits left in the bottom of the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes until the paste deepens in color.\nPour in the red wine and lift up anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the beef stock. Bring to a boil. Add the beef short ribs back to the pot and reduce heat to a low simmer. Simmer, covered, for 3 hours. Taste and season.\nRemove and discard the garlic cloves.

Cook for 25 minutes until the broth reduces by half and thickens. Mount the cold butter into the sauce, whisking to incorporate until glossy. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\nUsing your fork, tear the ribs into large pieces. Add them back to the sauce and toss to coat.\nPrepare the mashed potatoes:\nPeel and quarter the potatoes. Cover with salted water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 20-25 minutes until fork-tender.\nDrain the potatoes and return them to the warm pot. Allow any residual water to evaporate for 5 minutes. You can turn the heat to low to speed up this process.\nTransfer the potatoes to a bowl with the butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and heavy cream. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until they reach your desired consistency. Add the chives, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and paprika, and mash to incorporate. If the potatoes seem dry, add a few more splashes of heavy cream.\nTo serve:\nDivide the potatoes between plates. Add a few pieces of the beef on top and drizzle the sauce all over. Enjoy!"

        "top_comment": "Check out my Al Pastor Recipe for Tacos. This homemade version of pork & pineapple tacos is prepared with grilled tenderloin to get the result similar to traditionally used rotisserie, very quick in preparation and absolutely delicious.\nThe taco meat recipe includes the use of chipotle paste. However, if you have any traditional Mexican dried chilies like guajillo or ancho chilies, you can incorporate them into the marinade by rehydrating them, removing the seeds, and blending them into a paste.\n\u200b\nIngredients for Al Pastor:\n* 1 lbs Pork tenderloin - (450g) thinly sliced\n* 2 slices Pineapple - finely chopped\n* 1 Onion, medium size - cut in half and sliced\n* 1 Red bell pepper - sliced\n* 5 Garlic cloves - minced\n* 2 tsp Chipotle paste - (Instead you can use traditional Mexican dried chilies like guajillo or ancho chilies, rehydrate and use in the marinade)\n* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil\n* \u00bd tsp Salt\n\u200b\nIngredients for Al Pastor spice blend:\n* 1 tbsp Paprika\n* 1 tbsp Ground cumin\n* 1 tsp Epazote - (optional)\n* 1 tsp Oregano\n* \u00bd tsp Black pepper\n* 1 tsp Annatto seeds - (you can use achiote paste to marinate pork instead)\n* 2 Cloves\n\u200b\nTo serve:\n* 12 Small corn taco tortillas\n* Salsa\n* Guacamole\n* Pickled Red Jalape\u00f1o & Pineapple\n* 1 handful Fresh coriander - (cilantro)\n* Cheese - Choose: Oaxaca, Cheddar, Queso Fresco, Mozzarella.\n\u200b\nInstructions:\nIn a spice grinder, combine paprika, cumin, epazote (if using), oregano, black pepper, annatto seeds, and cloves. Grind into a fine powder.\nIn a large bowl, combine the spice blend, minced garlic, half of the vegetable oil, chopped pineapple and salt. Add the thinly sliced pork tenderloin and toss until the pork is well-coated with the marinade. (While refrigerating overnight will enhance the flavour, it's not a necessary step.).\nPreheat your grill to 460\u00b0F (240\u00b0C). Place the marinated pork on a tray and grill for about 12-15 minutes or until the pork is cooked through and has a slightly charred exterior. Go to another step while waiting for pork.\nIn a large skillet, heat the remaining vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Saut\u00e9 the onion and red bell pepper until they are soft and slightly caramelized, about 5-7 minutes. Then add a splash of water, cover with a lid, reduce the heat to medium, and cook for another 5 minutes.\nAdd grilled pork to the skillet with the saut\u00e9ed vegetables. Add 2 tsp of chipotle paste to the mixture, tossing everything together well to ensure the flavours meld. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on medium heat, stirring occasionally.\nWarm the taco tortillas in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 30 seconds on each side or until they are soft and pliable. To serve, place a few slices of pork and vegetable mixture on each tortilla. Top with your choice of salsa, guacamole, pickled red jalape\u00f1o & pineapple, fresh coriander, and cheese. Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade Al Pastor tacos!\nBlog post/print:\nTacos Al Pastor"

        "top_comment": "Hello, food lovers! The colder months are upon us, and in England, there\u2019s no heartier dish for the evening than Steak and Ale Pie with Guinness. This versatile recipe is expertly balanced to mitigate the bitterness of the stout, earning it the title of Best Ale Beef Pie. Additionally, I\u2019ve included methods for preparing it solely as a stew or using a slow cooker for added convenience. Lets get cooking!\nIngredients:\n* 1.1 lbs Beef stewing steak - (500g) diced\n* 3 Onions, medium size - peeled and diced\n* 2 Carrots, medium size - peeled and diced\n* 1 Celery stalk - fine dice\n* 6 Garlic cloves - sliced\n* 1.1 lbs Potatoes - (500g) large dice\n* 1 can Guinness - (440ml) or other ale or stout\n* 1.7 cups Beef stock - (400ml)\n* 2 tbsp Tomato paste\n* 1 tbsp Fresh thyme\n* 1 tsp Black pepper\n* 2 tbsp Vegetable oil\n* 2 tbsp All-purpose flour\n* 1 sheet Ready-rolled puff pastry\n* 1 Egg - beaten (for glazing)\nInstructions:\n1.\nIn a large pot or deep skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Toss the beef cubes in flour, shaking off the excess, and brown them in the hot oil. Remove and set aside.\n2.\nIn the same pot, add a bit more oil if needed and saut\u00e9 the onions, carrots, and celery until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes.\n3.\nPour in the Guinness and beef stock, then add the tomato paste. Stir well, ensuring all the brown bits from the bottom of the pot are incorporated.\n4.\nAdd the browned beef back into the pot, season with salt and pepper, and stir. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 1 hour.\n5.\nAfter 1 hour of simmering, add the diced potatoes into the pot and continue simmering for another 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until the beef is tender and the sauce has thickened.\n6.\nPreheat your oven to 356\u2109 (180\u00b0C) in preparation for baking the pie.\n7.\nOnce the filling is ready, if you prefer a thicker sauce, you can thicken it further using a gravy mix or a slurry of flour and water. Stir until the desired consistency is achieved. Transfer the thickened filling to a pie dish. Roll out the puff pastry and place it over the top of the filling, crimping the edges. Make a small slit in the centre for steam to escape. Brush the top with the beaten egg for a golden finish.\n8.\nBake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown and crisp.\n9.\nAllow the pie to rest for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy with a side salad or additional vegetables if desired :)\nBlog post/print version:\nSteak and Ale Pie - Chefs Binge"

Renowned as a staple in Caribbean street food, this beef hand pie is a perfect dish that embodies the essence of the tropical islands.\nTo craft this savoury treat, the beef is marinated and slow-cooked to perfection before being enveloped in a crisp dough, ready for shallow frying. Drawing inspiration from Trinidad\u2019s unique fusion of African, Creole, and Indian culinary traditions, this dish stands out in its flavour profile. Enjoy Cooking!\n\u200b\nIngredients for the marinade:\n* 0.9 lbs Beef Shin - (400g) small dice (or other stewing cut)\n* \u00bd tsp Salt\n* \u00bd tsp Black Pepper\n* 2 Scallions - sliced and washed\n* 1 handful Cilantro - (Coriander)\n* 1 Tomato, medium size - diced\n* 1 tbsp Ketchup\n* 1 tsp Mild Curry Powder\n* \u00bd Lime, juice only\n\u200b\nIngredients for the Aloo filling:\n* 3.5 oz Peas - (100g)\n* 14 oz Potatoes, waxy type - (400g) peeled and cut in small dice (keep them in water until needed)\n* 1 tsp Cumin\n* 1\u00bd tbsp Mild Curry Powder\n* 1 Red chilli - small dice\n* 3 Garlic clove - minced\n* 1 Onion, medium size - sliced\n* 3 tbsp Vegetable Oil\n* 1 Beef stock cube\n* 2\u00bd cups Water - (600ml)\n\u200b\nIngredients for the Aloo pastry:\n* 10 oz All Purpose Flour - (280g) sieved\n* \u00bc tsp Ground Cardamom\n* \u00bd tsp Ground Turmeric\n* \u00bd tsp Salt\n* 2 tsp Baking Powder\n* \u00be cup Water - (175ml)\n* 1\u2153 cup Vegetable Oil - for shallow frying\n\u200b\nInstructions for the Aloo Pie filling:\n1.\nTo start off, marinate the beef with a blend of salt, pepper, spring onions, coriander, tomato, ketchup, curry powder and lime juice. You may choose to marinate the beef overnight or just before cooking.\n2.\nIn a frying pan, heat 3 tbsp of oil over medium heat. Introduce onion, garlic, and chili, cooking until they turn golden-brown, around 5 minutes. Incorporate the curry powder and ground cumin, cooking for an additional 2 minutes. Pour in 4tbsp of water, allowing it to evaporate completely over the next 5 minutes.\n3.\nIncorporate the marinated beef into the pan, mixing thoroughly. Cover the pan, reduce the heat, and simmer for 35 minutes.\n4.\nAs the beef continues to cook, introduce potatoes and water, followed by a beef stock cube. Allow it to come to a boil before reducing to a simmer. Continue cooking uncovered for about 50 minutes or until it thickens and most of the water evaporates. Add peas in the last 10 minutes of cooking. Taste and adjust seasonings accordingly. Once done, transfer to a large plate, spreading it out to expedite cooling and ease handling.\n\u200b\nInstructions for the pastry and assembly:\n1.\nBegin dough preparation by combining sieved flour with baking powder, salt, turmeric, and cardamom. Knead this mixture into a ball, cover, and let it rest for a minimum of 30 minutes.\n2.\nDust your workspace with flour, dividing the dough into 8 even balls. Roll each into approximately 10cm diameter circles. Spoon the beef mixture into each circle's centre, sealing by folding and pinching the edges. Moistening the edges may aid in ensuring they adhere.\n3.\nPosition the pies on a cloth, potentially covering them with another cloth to retain moisture.\n4.\nPreheat oil in a pan to 374\u2109 (190\u2103) in readiness for shallow frying. Fry each pie for about a minute on each side. After frying, drain excess oil by placing the pies on paper towels.\n5.\nOnce all pies are cooked, serve them with mango chutney, salad, and dressing of your choice for a complete meal experience. Enjoy!\n\u200b\nRead more about the dish:\nTrinidad Aloo Pie"

If using a cast iron skillet, add 1 Tbsp Shortening and place it in the oven to preheat.\nWhisk together 2 cups Flour, all-purpose, 1 Tbsp Baking powder, 1/2 tsp Baking soda, and 1 tsp Salt, fine sea in a large mixing bowl. Note: If you are using milk instead of buttermilk, leave out the baking soda. Baking soda reacts with the acid in the buttermilk to help with leavening, if milk is used then it is not needed.\nCut \u00bc cup Butter, unsalted into cubes then using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour mixture. If you do not have a pastry blender you can either use two knives and slash them against each other, use your hands to squish the butter or if you have a food processor you can pulse it a few times.\nGradually add 1 cup Buttermilk (or milk) to the dry ingredients, if using milk you will need less of it since it isn't as thick. Depending on your environment, you may not need all of the buttermilk or you may need a bit more. The dough should be sticky but not too wet that you cannot handle it. If it becomes too sticky, simply add a bit more flour.\nDust a clean, flat surface with some flour and scoop out the dough. Sprinkle some flour on it then using your hands, knead a few times into a ball then fold the dough over itself 2 \u2013 3 times.\nPat the dough to about an \u00bd-inch in thickness. The thicker the dough, the higher the biscuits will be so feel free to adjust to your preference, you will just end up with more or less biscuits depending on thickness.\nCut the biscuits out with a biscuit cutter, cookie cutter or a cleaned out empty can. Set the biscuits aside.\nTake the dough scraps, knead them together, pat it out, and cut out some more biscuits. You should end up with 8-9 biscuits.\nOnce they are all cut, remove the cast iron skillet from the oven and carefully place each biscuit into the hot oil (if using). Carefully flip over each biscuit so both sides are coated in oil, this will ensure both sides get browned. You want to place them closer together but not touching. As they start to expand, they will be forced to expand upwards instead of outwards.\nCarefully place the pan back into the oven and bake for 10 minutes.\nCheck to see if they are golden brown and if so then remove from the oven. If they need more time, rotate the pan and keep an eye on them as they should be ready to pull within a few minutes."

To prevent them from browning, immerse the diced apples in water mixed with some of the lemon juice.\nCooking:\nIn a large pot, combine the apple dices, sugar, lemon zest, remaining lemon juice, cinnamon, fresh ginger, nutmeg, and water.\nBoiling:\nBring the mixture to a boil on high heat. Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer. Cook until the apples are soft and mushy.\nBlending:\nIf you like a smoother texture, blend the mixture (an immersion blender works great here). I used a regular blender though.\nFinal Boil:\nTransfer the blended mix (or keep it in the same pot if you used an immersion blender) and bring it to a boil once more. Then, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer until it thickens.\nTesting:\nTo check its readiness, place a little jam on a plate and draw a line through with your finger. If it maintains the separation and doesn\u2019t run, it\u2019s ready!\nStorage:\nSterilize your glass containers by boiling them. For the lids, a trick I learned is to clean them with vodka. Pour the hot jam into the jars, seal them, and let them cool to room temperature.\nServe it on bread, muffins, or even as a topping for desserts. The fresh ginger gives it a nice kick, and the blend of spices makes it taste like autumn in a jar! \ud83c\udf41\nHope you enjoy it as much as I did! If you give it a go, please share your results."

        "top_comment": "Check out my cherished family recipe for Polish Potato Pancakes (Placki Ziemniaczane) This is among my favourite potato dishes, ideal when paired with a savoury sauce or enjoyed by itself.\nMy love for potato pancakes was inherited from my grandfather. Whenever I visited his farm, he would prepare these large pancakes using potatoes he\u2019d grown himself. We would binge on them together, savouring every bite. Those moments really stuck with me, and I\u2019ve loved them ever since. I was hooked.\n\u200b\nIngredients:\n* 2.2 lbs Large Starchy Potatoes - (1kg or 4-5 large potatoes) Russet, Yukon Gold or other floury variety.\n* 1 Medium Onion\n* 3 Garlic Cloves\n* 1 Egg\n* 2-3 tbsp All-Purpose Flour - (Plain Flour)\n* \u00be cup Vegetable Oil - (200ml) for shallow frying\n* 1-2 tsp Salt\n* Black Pepper - to taste\n\u200b\nInstructions:\n1.\nGrate the peeled potatoes using the large holes of a grater. For the onion and garlic, you can mince them using a food processor. Then, add them to the grated potatoes.\n2.\nPlace the grated potato, onion, and garlic mixture into a fine mesh strainer or cheese cloth, and squeeze out as much liquid as you can. This step ensures the pancakes become crispier. (keep the liquid, read the recipe notes)\n3.\nTransfer the strained mixture to a large bowl. Add the egg, flour, salt, and pepper. Mix well until everything is thoroughly combined.\n4.\nIn a large frying pan, heat half of the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, take a two spoonful of the potato mixture, flatten it into a pancake shape in the hot oil. 5.\n5.\nFry each side until golden brown and crispy, roughly 2-3 minutes per side (You may need to add more oil later).\n6.\nAfter frying, place the pancakes on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.\n7.\nServe the potato pancakes while hot. They pair wonderfully with sour cream or your favourite sauce.\n\u200b\nNotes:\nBest Potatoes for Latkes:\nStarchy potatoes, like Russet or Yukon Gold, are ideal for this recipe as they yield a crispier pancake.\nBatter Consistency: Ensure the consistency of the batter is thick enough to hold together. If it seems too wet, you can add a bit more flour. Conversely, if it feels too dry, consider adding another egg.\nPotato Starch:\nAfter squeezing the water from the grated potatoes, don\u2019t discard the liquid immediately. Let it settle for a moment. At the bottom of the bowl, you\u2019ll notice some potato starch sediment. This is pure potato starch, and you can carefully pour off the water and then add this starch back into your potato mixture. It can enhance the texture of the pancakes and make them more cohesive.\nPancake Size:\nThe size of your potato pancakes can vary based on how you intend to serve them. You can opt for smaller or larger sizes. My grandfather, for instance, used to make them as large as the entire pan! \ud83d\ude42\nOriginally posted:\nPolish Potato Pancakes - ChefsBinge"

You need room to stack the plates of protein and veg.\nFish: 300g\nAbout the same volume as rice. Cut into very small pieces, to make sure it cooks in the steam. I happened to have Panagsius (the absolute cheapest fish I can get around here; best way I can describe it is catfish but mushy), but any firm fleshed fish like catfish or grouper would also work. Season it with salt and white pepper as well as some corn starch, and optionally top with XO sauce for some extra savoury flavour.\nBroccoli: 1 small head\nAlso approximately the same volume as the rice. I used broccoli, cut into florets and sprinkled with salt. Other vegetables like green beans, asparagus or cauliflower would also work.\nInstructions:\nBegin by making the rice. Put rice and water into the rice cooker and start it.\nCut and season the fish. Arrange on a heat-resistant plate and top.\nOnce the water in the rice cooker is boiling, place the dish with the fish into the rice cooker.\nCut, season and arrange broccoli onto another heat-resistant plate.\nWith a few minutes left on the rice cooker\u2019s timer, place the broccoli into the rice cooker as well.\nTower of Doom is complete!

And what better way to embrace the season than with a French classic?\n\u200b\nPortions:\n4\nPrep time: 30 min\nCook time: 1,5h\n\u200b\nIngredients:\n* 4 Chicken legs separated into thighs and drumsticks\n* 3 cups Red Wine (750 ml) preferably Burgundy or a similar full-bodied wine\n* 1 cup Pearl Onions (200g) peeled\n* \u00bd cup Lardons (100g) or thick-cut bacon, diced\n* 3 Sprigs of fresh Thyme\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n* 4 Garlic Cloves minced\n* 2 Shallots finely chopped\n* 1 cup Button Mushrooms quartered\n* 2 tbsp Brandy (optional)\n* 2 tbsp Unsalted Butter\n* 2 tbsp All-purpose flour\n* Salt to taste\n* Black Pepper to taste\n* Fresh Parsley for garnish\n\u200b\nInstructions:\nIn a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, red wine, thyme sprigs, bay leaves, minced garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well, ensuring the chicken is well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.\nIn a large skillet or Dutch oven, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the lardons or bacon and cook until crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.\nIn the same skillet, add the remaining butter. Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the wine and herbs. Pat the chicken dry and brown on all sides, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove the chicken and set aside.\nAdd the chopped shallots to the skillet and saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Add the garlic and saut\u00e9 for another minute. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and become golden.\nIf using, pour the brandy over the vegetables and carefully ignite with a long lighter. Allow the flames to subside.\nSprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes.\nPour in the reserved wine from the marinade, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Allow the wine to simmer and reduce by a third.\nReturn the browned chicken pieces and crispy lardons to the skillet. Add the pearl onions, thyme, and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper.\nStove top cooking method: Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let the chicken simmer in the wine for about 1-1.5 hours, or until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened.\nDutch oven cooking method: After combining the chicken, lardons, pearl onions, thyme, and bay leaves in the Dutch oven, cover with the lid and bake in a preheated oven at 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C) for 1-1.5 hours until the chicken is tender and the sauce has thickened, checking occasionally and adding broth or water if needed.\nOnce cooked, remove the thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve the Coq au Vin hot, sprinkled with fresh parsley. Pair with crusty French bread or potatoes and enjoy this classic French dish! I prepared potato pancakes to go with it \ud83d\ude42\nChefs Recipe Blog -\nFrench Classic - Coq au Vin"

Season liberally with salt and pepper. Add the halved garlic head and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes until chicken is completely cooked through and falling off the bone. Remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a bowl to cool. Remove the garlic and transfer to a plate to cool.\nBring the broth back to a boil for 15 minutes until it reduces down a bit. (Note: you can skip this step, but I like a very rich, reduced broth).\nStrain the broth into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve. Wipe out the pot and return it to the stove.\nOnce the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred the meat and discard the skin and carcass.\nPop the garlic cloves out of the paper and discard the paper. With a fork, mash the cloves into a paste and set aside.\nPrepare the Chicken Verde Soup:\nHeat the extra virgin olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the sliced yellow onion and cook for 5 minutes until it begins to soften. Add the garlic paste and cook for 45 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.\nPour in reserved chicken stock and bring to a boil. Add the cilantro, scallions, jalape\u00f1o, and shredded chicken. Reduce heat and cook for 15 minutes or until the onion is very soft and the broth is aromatic. Taste and season to your preferences. Add more water if needed. Turn off the heat.\nTo Serve\nLadle the soup into bowls and garnish with the reserved cilantro, scallions and avocado. Squeeze lime juice over each bowl.

Continue until the pieces of butter are pea-sized or smaller, and evenly distributed throughout. Sprinkle in all of the\nchopped herbs\nand 100g of the\ngrated\u00a0cheese\n. Mix again until well combined.\nMake a well in the centre of the flour mixture and pour in 100g of\ncream\n. Stir through the\ndijon\u00a0mustard\n, then combine the dry and wet ingredients until you arrive at a soft-but-firm dough that just comes together when pressed in your hand. If necessary, add up to 20g more of cream \u2014 a good way to do this is to remove the well-formed dough from the bowl and add liquid only to the dry crumbs remaining at the bottom, bit by bit. This enables you to hydrate only the parts of the mixture that need it, and avoids over-moistening the already-ready parts of the dough.\nTip the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and use the palm of your hand as little as you can to pat it out into a rough circle, about 2cm/\u00bein thick. Using a lightly floured 5.5cm/2\u2033 wide glass or biscuit cutter, cut out 9 or so scones, reforming the dough into a rough disk as needed in between rounds of cutting.\nAt this point, if you have room in your fridge or freezer, place the scones on a baking tray lined with parchment paper and transfer them to either to cool. In the meantime, bring a small pan of salted water to a boil. Pop in your reserved\nsage leaves\nfor 30-45 seconds, just long enough to blanch them, then transfer them to a plate lined with a dish towel and pat them dry. Doing this will help prevent the leaves from shrivelling up too much and burning in the oven while the scones bake. At this point you may also want to brush each sage leaf with a bit of\nolive oil\n, although you don\u2019t have to \u2014 it\u2019ll make the leaves extra crisp.\nRemove the scones from the fridge or freezer if you left them to chill. Brush each scone top with a bit of\ncream\n, then sprinkle the\nremaining\u00a0cheese\nevenly over each scone, and top each one with a\nsage leaf\n.\nBake for 17 minutes or so (every oven is different!), or until the scones have well risen and their cheesy tops look crisp and golden. Once out of the oven, they should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Serve immediately, or enjoy for up to 4 days post-bake: simply store in an airtight container at room temperature and reheat in the oven before savouring again.\nEnjoy!\nNotes:\nWhen it comes to scones, you want to keep the butter cold until the very end to maximise the level of flakiness in your finished bake. One way to do this is to chill the butter before you combine it with the other ingredients, and then, once shaped, to chill the unbaked scones once more just before placing them in the oven.\nFor more tips and details, feel free to check out the whole post here\n:)"

Do not turn the oven off.\nOnce the kabocha is cool enough to handle, cut the kabocha in half from the top stem to the bottom of the kabocha.\nScoop out the seeds and transfer them to a sieve.\nPeel one half of the kabocha and cut the flesh into bite-sized cubes. Set aside.\nLeave the skin on the remaining half of the kabocha and cut it into 2\u201d cubes. Set aside.\nPrepare the soup base:\nHeat the remaining 1 tablespoon avocado oil in a large pot. Add the onion and cook for 7 minutes until it softens. Add the peeled kabocha cubes to the onion and cook for 3\u20135 minutes until it begins to turn golden brown. Season with salt and pepper.\nMelt the butter into the pot and add the chili oil and sesame oil. Pour in the water or broth and bring to a boil.

Rinse the warm seeds under water and remove the stringy bits of kabocha from them. Pat the seeds dry and arrange on the same baking sheet used for the kabocha. Add more oil, if needed.\nSeason with salt and pepper and transfer to the oven for 10 minutes, flipping once midway through. Remove from the oven once the seeds are golden brown and crispy. Set aside.\nCook the rice:\nOnce the kabocha is very tender, mash it with a potato masher or use an immersion blender to blend until completely smooth. Add the rice and the skin-on kabocha and season with salt. Keep the heat on low and simmer for 30 minutes or until the kabocha cubes and rice are very tender. Add more water as necessary if the liquid evaporates too quickly. Stir the soup regularly to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

I'd say it's most similar in texture to European style crackle cookies.\nGuide with photos:\nMexican Hot Chocolate Cookies\nINGREDIENTS\n\u2022 300 grams Flour AP\n\u2022 120 grams Dutch Process Cocoa Powder\n\u2022 10 grams Cinnamon, ground. Plus more for rolling.\n\u2022 10 grams Baking Powder\n\u2022 5 grams Baking Soda\n\u2022 1 tbsp Chili Powder, more or less to taste. With 1 tbsp you can taste the chili, but it isn\u2019t actually spicy (to me). Make of that what you will.\n\u2022 10 grams Vanilla Sugar I used Bourbon Vanilla Powdered Sugar but you can use 2 tsp of Vanilla Extract as a substitute.\n\u2022 1/2 tsp Salt\n\u2022 200 grams Butter\n\u2022 250 grams Sugar white granulated\n\u2022 2 large Eggs\n\u2022 2 tbsp Confectioner\u2019s Sugar aka powdered sugar, for rolling. (may need more or less depending on the size of your bowl.\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPreheat your oven to 170 Celsius or 350 Fahrenheit with the convection setting.\nSift together the flour, cocoa powder, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, chili powder, and vanilla sugar and then add the salt.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer add the butter and sugar and cream them together using the paddle attachment. When creamed crack in the eggs and mix to form a paste.\nOn the slowest speed add the dry ingredients to the wet a tablespoon at a time until everything is incorporated.\nIn a bowl whisk together a few tbsp of the confectioners sugar with some ground cinnamon.\nUse a tablespoon to scoop out a chunk of the cookie dough and roll it into a ball between your palms. I created about a 2 tbsp worth ball (about the size of an egg). Place them on a parchment or silicone lined baking tray.\nFlatten the balls a bit with the palm of your hand and place the tray in the oven to bake for 12 minutes. Remove and let rest on the tray for 5 minutes before moving to a wire cooling rack."

Set over a low heat & warm until steaming (don't boil!).\nIn the meantime, add the egg yolks, remaining sugar, milk powder & cornflour into a heatproof mixing bowl & whisk to combine.\nPour a third of the warm milk into the yolks & whisk them together.\nPour the tempered yolks into the pan of remaining milk & cook over a low heat until thickened & has reached a temperature of 82\u00b0c. Make sure to stir the custard constantly with a rubber spatula to stop it from catching. 5. Pass the custard into a jug, through a sieve then serve immediately.\nToffee Sauce\nPlace the cream, sugar, butter & golden syrup into a medium sized saucepan then place over a low heat.\nCook until the butter has melted & the sugar has dissolved then increase the heat & bring to the boil. Cook for 2-3 minutes then remove from the heat & stir in the vanilla & salt. Set aside & leave to cool. 2. Next, grease the pudding moulds with softened butter then add a tablespoon of toffee sauce into the bottom of each one. Set aside in the fridge until ready to use.\nThe Sponge\nPreheat an oven to 170\u00b0c/150\u00b0c fan (340\u00b0f/300\u00b0f fan).\nChop the dates into small pieces & place into a bowl with the bicarbonate of soda & boiling water. Leave to soak for 10-15 minutes then blitz with a stick blender/food processor until smooth.\nIn the meantime, sift together the flour, baking powder, ginger, cinnamon & salt. Set aside.\nPlace the softened butter & sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer then use the paddle attachment to beat until light & fluffy. This will take at least 5 minutes on a medium speed.\nNext, mix in the egg, followed by the black treacle.\nAdd in half of the flour & half of the date puree & mix until just combined.\nScrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula then add in the remaining flour, dates & the sour cream. Mix until just combined.\nTransfer the cake batter into a large jug then pour an equal amount into each mould.\nPlace the moulds onto a baking tray then bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes. A skewer inserted into the centre should come out clean.\nOnce cooked, leave to cool for 5 minutes then use a sharp, serrated knife to trim each sponge level to the top of the mould.\nTip each sponge out onto a plate then pour over some hot toffee sauce.\nTo warm up the sauce, heat on high in a microwave until bubbling or warm in a saucepan over a medium heat."

Add the remaining 1 cup of water only if needed and stir after adding it. Taste and add salt and pepper. This process will take 20\u201325 minutes.\nOnce the rice is tender, turn off the heat. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, half of the minced scallion greens, and the Parmesan cheese until melted. Add the lemon juice. Taste and season once more.\nRoast the broccoli:\nArrange the broccoli florets on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.\nAs soon as you add the carnaroli rice to the pot for the risotto, transfer the broccoli to the oven. Roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and cover with foil. Keep warm and keep the oven heated to 425\u00baF.\nCook the pork chops:\nPat the pork chops dry and season all over with salt and pepper.\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and cook for 3\u20134 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven for 15\u201317 minutes. Once the pork chops reach 140\u00baF, remove them from the oven and rest on a cutting board for 5\u201310 minutes.\nSlice the pork chops thinly and arrange on a serving platter with the roasted broccoli.\nTo serve:\nSpoon the risotto into shallow bowls. Arrange the sliced pork chop on top and serve with the broccoli on the side. Garnish with freshly minced parsley and the remaining minced scallion greens. Enjoy!\nNotes:\nContinue with roasting the broccoli and the pork chops as you cook the risotto. While you should stir the risotto regularly, you can take breaks periodically to roast the broccoli and fry up the pork chops. It just requires a bit of multitasking!"

If you have fresh kimchi, feel free to chop it up and throw it in instead of dehydrated.\nIngredients:\n1 pound firm tofu\n1 tablespoon neutral oil\n8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced\n1 shallot, peeled and diced\n\u00bc cup gochujang\n1 tablespoon vegan kimchi paste, optional\n6 cups water or vegetable broth\n1 tablespoon dehydrated kimchi or \u00bc cup fresh kimchi, chopped\n3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce more or less to taste\n3 teaspoons sesame oil, divided\n8.4 ounces ramen noodles or use 4 blocks of instant ramen noodles\n14.5- ounce can full-fat coconut milk\n5 scallions, thinly sliced; white and green parts kept separate\n1 cup frozen edamame\n1 teaspoon sesame seeds\nSalt to taste\nPress the tofu:\nDrain the tofu and wrap it with paper towels.

Spread evenly on a baking sheet.\nPlace baking sheet in the oven and cook until squash begins to brown and becomes tender and delicious looking, about 20 minutes.\nWhile the squash is cooking, toss the chopped apples in the remainder of the Walnut Oil and Sage (I add a dash of salt and pepper too).\nAdd the diced apples onto the sheet pan, and stir to combine everything evenly. Place in oven for another 10 minutes.\nDuring this cook time, immersion blend or stir together the Maple Syrup, Brown Mustard, and Apple Cider Vinegar.\nAt this point the apples should still have some firmness, and the squash should be very tender. Take the Maple Syrup and Mustard mixture and drizzle it over the apples and squash. Place back in the oven and cook for 5 more minutes.\nRemove from oven and plate! I garnished mine with some fresh Nasturtiums from the garden, but any fresh addition on top would be nice. Tarragon or Chives would be lovely! I've also garnished with sumac or cinnamon in other variations. I hope you enjoy it!"

Turn heat to low and keep warm. Preheat oven to 425\u00baF.\nStart the Risotto:\nHeat the olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 2-3 minutes until it just begins to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook for 12-13 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are golden brown.\nThey should release all their liquid, and the liquid should evaporate from the pan. Add the garlic and cook for 45 seconds until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper.\nCook the Chicken:\nAs the mushrooms are cooking, start the chicken. Pat the chicken dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Heat neutral cooking oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook without moving for 5 minutes until the skin is very crispy and browned. Flip the chicken and transfer to the oven for 20-25 minutes until completely cooked through. Turn off the oven and keep the chicken in the oven as you finish the risotto to keep it warm.\nCook the Rice:\nMelt the butter into the pot and add the rice. Cook, stirring regularly, for 2-3 minutes until the rice is coated with butter and begins to turn golden brown.\nAdd the aji amarillo paste and toss to coat.\nPour in the white wine and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low.\nOnce the wine has been absorbed, add 1 cup of the stock and stir regularly until absorbed. Continue on, adding a cup of stock, stirring until absorbed, and then adding more stock until all of the stock has been incorporated, about 20-25 minutes total. Taste and season to your preferences. Turn off the heat and allow the risotto to rest for 5 minutes before serving.\nTo Serve:\nDivide the risotto between shallow bowls and serve with a chicken thigh on top. Garnish with parsley, if desired.

It\u2019s often garnished with fresh cucumber slices and drizzled with a savory, sweet sauce before serving. This meal is a fusion of Thai and Chinese cuisine, where it\u2019s known as char siu.\nRecipe:\nhttps://hungryinthailand.com/recipe/khao-moo-dang/\n\u200b\nIngredients for marinating the pork\n\u2022\n3 cloves of garlic\n\u2022\n2 coriander root\n\u2022\n1.5 tablespoons Chinese five spice powder\n\u2022\n1 teaspoon white pepper\n\u2022\n4 tablespoons palm sugar\n\u2022\n1\u20442 tablespoons sesame oil\n\u2022\n2 tablespoons oyster sauce\n\u2022\n2 tablespoons light soy sauce\n\u2022\n1 tablespoon tapioca starch\n\u2022\n1\u20444 teaspoons red food coloring\n\u2022\n18 ounces pork (pork loin)\nIngredients for making the sauce\n\u2022\n1 tablespoon palm sugar\n\u2022\n1\u20442 tablespoons sesame oil\n\u2022\n1\u20442 tablespoons roasted sesame seeds\n\u2022\n1\u20442 teaspoons dark soy sauce\n\u2022\n1 tablespoon light soy sauce\n\u2022\n5 fluid ounces red sauce (from marinating the pork)\n\u2022\n5 fluid ounces of water\n\u2022\n1 teaspoon tapioca starch (optional, for thickening the sauce, mix with water)\nInstructions\n1.\nCrush garlic and coriander root with a mortar and pestle.\n2.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the garlic & coriander root mixture, Chinese five spice powder, white pepper, palm sugar, sesame oil, oyster sauce, light soy sauce, and tapioca starch. Add the food coloring and thoroughly mix one more time.\n3.\nAdd pork and coat each part with the sauce. Marinate in your refrigerator overnight. (Keep the marinade sauce \u2013 don\u2019t discard it!!)\n4.\nThere are two cooking methods for the pork:\nUse an air fryer; place the meat in a single layer and cook at 320\u00b0F / 160\u00b0C, then flip andcook the other side for 5 more minutes. This is the method I like best.\nGrill over charcoal until the pork is fully cooked, flip occasionally to prevent burning.Alternatively, you can use a grilling pan.\n5.\nAfter cooking it, we\u2019ll let the meat rest for a few minutes before slicing, this will increase its tenderness and allows the juices to spread evenly. Meanwhile, we can make the sauce.\nAdd palm sugar, sesame oil, sesame seeds, dark soy sauce, and light soy sauce into the leftover marinade sauce and mix thoroughly.\n6.\nMove the sauce to a pot or wok over medium heat. Once it starts bubbling, pour in water. If the sauce isn\u2019t your desired thickness, consider mixing the optional tapioca starch with 5 fl oz of water. Add gradually and stir until it\u2019s just right.\n7.\nSlice the pork against the grain into long strips. Serve immediately. Scoop a portion of rice onto a plate, top with red pork slices, and drizzle with red sauce.\nPS, don't forget to make a batch of jasmine rice."

Place 4, small loaf pans onto clean baking pan (note: make sure there is NO oil on surface of pans! I used small (5\"x3\") silicone loaf pans. If using other non-stick baking pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper)\nIn a small bowl, mix together 2/3 cup of sugar and 2/3 cup of flour to aerate and sift. Set aside.\nIn a large bowl, and with an electric mixer on low speed, beat egg whites with salt and cream of tartar until frothy. Increase speed to medium-high and gradually add 1/3 cup of sugar until mixture resembles stiff peaks (note: this step may take a few extra minutes if using carton egg whites). Fold in vanilla extract.\nIn 3 additions, gently fold flour/sugar mixture into egg white mixture until well incorporated and no flour pockets remain.\nEqually distribute spoonfuls of angel food cake mixture into each mini loaf pan. Bake for ~45 minutes or until angel food cakes have risen, spring back when lightly touched, and are gently browned on the surface.\nOnce removed from the oven, invert cakes and allow them to cool completely upside-down (either on a wire rack or with sides of pans resting on cups/container). Allow to cool completely at room temperature.\nUse knife to loosen sides of loaf pan and invert onto flat surface. Optional: Top with sweetened whipped cream and fresh berries.\nEnjoy!\nNotes\nIf making this dessert in other cake pans,\u00a0evenly distribute the batter\u00a0amongst pans and\u00a0adjust baking time\u00a0accordingly (when done, cakes should have\u00a0risen and be lightly brown\u00a0on the surface)"

        "top_comment": "In this recipe, I will introduce a technique commonly used in restaurants for preparing curry. To start, we will prepare a curry base gravy, which serves as the foundation for many Indian curries. This versatile and flavourful sauce will be the key ingredient in our Vegetable Balti. Additionally, you can utilize this base gravy in  other curry dishes as well.\nPortions:\n4-6 servings\nPreparation time:\n30 minutes\nBase Gravy cooking time:\n40 minutes\nVegetable Balti cooking time:\n35 minutes\n\u200b\nIngredients for Curry Base Gravy:\n* 4tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil\n* 2tbsp cumin seeds (use ground if not available)\n* 1tbsp coriander seeds (use ground if not available)\n* 1tbsp ground turmeric\n* 1/2tsp red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)\n* 1tbsp garam masala\n* 1tbsp paprika\n* 2 large onions diced\n* 1 medium carrot diced\n* 4tsp garlic ginger paste\n* 400g of chopped tomatoes\n* 700ml of vegetable stock (plus more if needed)\n\u200b\nIngredients for Vegetable Balti:\n* 2tbsp of ghee or vegetable oil\n* 2 medium-size onions, cut into four then broken apart\n* 1 green pepper, cut into 8\n* 1 red pepper, cut into 8\n* 2 medium-size tomatoes cut into wedges\n* a handful of white cabbage cut into squares\n* 10 Okra fingers, tops removed and cut in half\n* two handfuls of frozen peas\n* 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced\n* half of small cauliflower, cut into florets\n* 1tbsp ginger garlic paste\n* 2-3 ladles of base curry gravy\n* 2tbsp of yoghurt\n* knob of butter (skip if using ghee)\n\u200b\nInstructions for Curry Base Gravy:\n1.\nIn a large saucepan or pot, heat the ghee or vegetable oil over medium heat.\n2.\nAdd the cumin seeds and coriander seeds to the hot oil. If you have ground cumin, you can add it later along with the other spices. Saut\u00e9 the cumin and coriander seeds for a minute or until they start releasing their aroma.\n3.\nAdd the diced onions and carrots to the pan. Cook and stir them for about 5-6 minutes or until the onions become soft and translucent.\n4.\nNow, add the garlic ginger paste to the pan. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring continuously, until the raw smell of garlic and ginger disappears.\n5.\nMix in the turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and paprika (if using ground cumin, add it now). Stir everything together to coat the vegetables with the spices evenly.\n6.\nAdd the chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook and stir for about 5 minutes or until the tomatoes become soft and start breaking down.\n7.\nPour in the vegetable stock, and give the mixture a good stir. Bring it to a gentle boil.\n8.\nLower the heat to a simmer, cover the pan, and let the curry base gravy cook for about 20-25 minutes. The vegetables should become tender, and the flavours will meld together.\n9.\nOnce the vegetables are fully cooked, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down slightly.\n10.\nUsing a blender or an immersion blender, blend the mixture until you achieve a smooth and thick curry base gravy. If the consistency is too thick for your liking, you can add more vegetable stock to reach the desired thickness.\n11.\nTaste the gravy and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt or spices if needed.\nYour curry base gravy is now ready to use! You can use it immediately in your favourite curry dishes or store it for later use. This flavourful base will enhance the taste of your curries, whether you're preparing vegetarian, chicken, lamb, or any other type of curry.\n\u200b\nHow to prepare Vegetable Balti:\n1.\nHeat the ghee or vegetable oil in a Balti pan or a large wok over medium heat. Add the broken apart onions to the pan and stir-fry for a few minutes until they start to soften.\n2.\nToss in the potatoes, green and red peppers, and continue stir-frying for a couple of minutes.\n3.\nAdd the tomato wedges to the pan and saut\u00e9 briefly until they start to break down and release their juices.\n4.\nIncorporate the white cabbage, okra, frozen peas and cauliflower florets into the pan. Stir everything together to mix the vegetables evenly.\n5.\nAdd the ginger garlic paste and continue to stir-fry for a minute or two, ensuring the vegetables are coated with the paste.\n6.\nPour in the base curry gravy. Start with 2 ladles and adjust the quantity based on how saucy you want the Balti to be.\n7.\nStir everything together and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the vegetables cook in the gravy for about 15-20 minutes or until they are fully cooked but still retain their texture.\n8.\nCheck the seasoning and add salt or additional spices if needed.\n9.\nStir in the yogurt and mix it well with the vegetables and gravy. This will add a creamy richness to the dish.\n10.\nIf you're using vegetable oil, add a knob of butter at this stage to enhance the flavours of the Vegetable Balti.\n11.\nOnce the vegetables are cooked to your liking and the flavours have melded together, turn off the heat. Your Vegetable Balti is now ready to be served! Transfer it to a serving dish, and you can garnish it with chopped fresh coriander leaves if desired. Enjoy this flavourful and aromatic dish with naan, rice, or any bread of your choice. Enjoy!\nOriginally posted:\nVegetable Balti"

The mixture should be just warm, registering between 100-110\u02daF (37-43\u02daC). If any warmer, allow to cool slightly.\nSprinkle the yeast evenly over the milk mixture, stir, and let sit in a warm place for about 10 minutes until the yeast has bloomed.\nAdd 4 cups (500 g) of flour to the milk mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just combined.\nCover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until nearly doubled in size.\nGenerously butter 2 9-inch (23 cm) round baking pans and set aside.\nMake the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon.

Leave a bit of flour nearby to use as needed, but try not to incorporate too much.\nKnead the dough for at least 10 minutes, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface or your hands. The dough should be very smooth and spring back when poked.\nRoll the dough out into a large rectangle, about \u00bd-inch (1 cm) thick. Fix the corners with a bench scraper or a spatula to make sure they are sharp and even.\nSpread the filling evenly over the dough.\nStarting from one short end, roll up the dough into a log and pinch the seam closed. Place seam-side down. Trim any uneven ends.\n12. Using unflavored dental floss, cut the log into evenly pieces, about 1\u00bd inches (8cm) thick. Place the cinnamon rolls in the prepared pans, 1 in the center and about 5 around the sides. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for 35-45 minutes, until expanded by about half of their original volume. If you\u2019re saving the cinnamon rolls for later, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for up 3 months.\nHeat the oven to 350\u02daF (180\u02daC). Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown.\nWhile the cinnamon rolls are baking, make the frosting: In a medium bowl, mix butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Add hot water 1 tablespoon at a time until the glaze reaches desired consistency. Spread over slightly cooled rolls.\nWhen the cinnamon rolls are finished, let cool for about 10 minutes.\nDrizzle the frosting over the cinnamon rolls, using the back of a spoon to spread if desired."

You want to use juicy, super ripe tomatoes...avoid Roma tomatoes as they are too dry/firm.\nI use this process for homemade salsa because honestly, i just hate chopping up tomatoes (I have slight eczema on my fingers and the acidity of tomatoes really effs up my fingers) so grating is a really nice way to prep them for me!\nJust be mindful that there's a LOT of water in the grated tomatoes so you want to cook it off. I don't like straining them because I like cooking down the liquid; I think it makes a more flavorful sauce.\nIngredients:\n1\u00bd pounds large, ripe tomatoes (or use 14.5-ounce can crushed tomatoes)\n1 pound hot Italian sausage\n2 tablespoons butter\n1 yellow onion, peeled and diced\n4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced\n2 small zucchini, trimmed and diced\nCrushed red pepper to taste\nPinch of sugar optional\n16 ounces rigatoni\n5 ounces baby spinach\n1 lemon, juiced\n\u00bd cup Parmesan, finely grated; a pinch reserved for garnish\nSalt and pepper\nPrep the tomatoes:\nCut off a very thin slice from the bottom of the tomatoes.\nGrate the tomatoes into a large bowl using the large holes of a box grater. Discard the skins.\nCook the sausage:\nHeat a wide pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the sausage and cook, breaking it up periodically, for 12\u201315 minutes until cooked through. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and drain off all but a teaspoon of the oil in the pot.\nPrepare the sauce:\nMelt the butter into the pot and add the onion. Cook for 5\u20137 minutes until soft. Add the garlic and zucchini and fry for 1\u20132 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of crushed red pepper to taste.\nReturn the sausage to the pot and pour in the grated tomatoes. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 20\u201330 minutes or until the sauce is thick. Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from sticking. The grated tomatoes make quite a bit of excess water, so you want to cook it all off!  Taste and season with salt and pepper.\nBoil the pasta:\nBring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add a generous amount of salt and the rigatoni. Cook until 1-2 minutes under al dente. Scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water and drain the pasta.\nFinish the pasta:\nTaste the sauce and season once more. Add the baby spinach, lemon juice, and cooked pasta. Toss to coat for 2\u20133 minutes until the spinach is wilted. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and toss to coat for 1 minute more. Add pasta water if needed to loosen up the sauce and coat the pasta. Turn off the heat.\nTo serve:\nDivide the pasta between shallow bowls. Sprinkle more Parmesan on each plate. Enjoy!"

Heat up some oil in a pan on medium heat. Add the onion and stir until somewhat translucent. Add in the Calabrian chili and garlic and continue stirring for another minute or so.\nAdd the tomato paste and stir it around to mix with the other stuff in the pan, then pour in the vodka. Stir the vodka around and let everything reduce a bit, about 3-5 minutes. Here you can add the pasta to the boiling salted water and cook until al dente.\nNext add in the butter and chili flakes and stir until the butter is fully melted, then pour in the cream. Stir the pan around until well combined, then lower the heat to low.\nWhen the pasta is ready, about 2 minutes less than what the box will usually say, remove a cup of water from the pot. Set aside. Drain the pasta and add the rigatoni right to the sauce. 4. Give everything a mix and re-add the reserved water to the pan about a quarter cup at a time until you reach desired consistency. You don't need to use all of the water.\nPlate the pasta, grate over some good quality Parmigiano Reggiano, and sprinkle over some basil chiffonade. Enjoy!"

Add the pork and cook, breaking it up as it cooks, for 12\u201315 minutes until nicely browned. Continue cooking until the pork deepens in color and crisps up around the edges. You want crispy bits!\nDrain off all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the skillet.\nMix together 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine, and sugar. Pour the mixture into the pork. Bring to a boil and cook for 2\u20133 minutes, lifting up anything stuck to the bottom. Transfer the pork to a large bowl.\nCook the noodles:\nWhile the pork browns, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions. Drain, rinse, and set aside.\nCook the aromatics:\nKeep the heat on the skillet at medium-high. Add the shallot, garlic, ginger, Thai chili peppers, and minced scallions. Saut\u00e9 for 1\u20132 minutes until fragrant. Transfer to the bowl of pork.\nCook the mushrooms:\nIf needed, add a touch of oil. Add the mushrooms to the skillet and saut\u00e9 them for 5\u20136 minutes over medium-high heat. Be careful with shiitakes. They have a lower water content than other mushrooms and can dry out very quickly! Once lightly golden brown, transfer the mushrooms to the bowl of pork.\nCook the cabbage and carrots:\nAdd the cabbage and carrots (in batches, if needed) to the skillet. Saut\u00e9 over medium-high heat until the cabbage wilts and the carrots soften about 5\u20136 minutes. Season lightly with salt. Transfer the cabbage and carrots to the bowl of pork.\nPrepare the sauce:\nAdd 2 teaspoons of sesame oil to the skillet. Add the XO sauce and cook for 1 minute. Pour in the water, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Bring to a boil for 1 minute. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.\nScoop out a tablespoon or so of the sauce. Whisk it together with the cornstarch until a slurry forms.\nReturn the cornstarch mixture to the sauce and stir to incorporate. Continue simmering for 3\u20135 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. If you like saucier noodles, add more water, soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine in 3:1:1 proportions. You may need more cornstarch to thicken it if you add more liquid. You can also add more XO sauce for an even richer sauce.\nFinish the noodles:\nAdd the noodles to the skillet along with all but a few tablespoons of the pork mixture. Toss to combine over low heat until the noodles are warmed through, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Don\u2019t let them cook on the heat too long! Turn off the heat.\nTo serve:\nDivide the noodles between shallow bowls. Spoon a bit more of the pork and veggie mixture on each dish. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions and crispy shallots if you like. Enjoy!"

You don't need to touch it. Once it is just caramelized add in all the walnuts and stir/toss the pan around so all the walnuts are coated. Pour the contents in one layer onto a sheet of parchment paper and let cool.\nIn a bowl add the chicken pieces along with the soy sauces, rice wine, and potato starch. Mix everything up and let sit while you cook the mushrooms.\nBack in the pan add the oil and put the heat on medium high. When hot add in the quartered mushrooms and let cook. It's hard to overcook mushrooms so you don't need to worry with the pan too much. I let them brown on the edges and toss the pan every minute or so. After the mushrooms are sufficiently browned add the bowl of chicken and the marinade.\nAs soon as you add the chicken and marinade to the pan start stirring/tossing the pan. The chicken will only take 2-3 minutes to cook. While the chicken is cooking you can break up the walnuts.\nTake the parchment paper with the walnuts on it and roll it up into a ball. Smack the ball on the countertop a few times to break up the walnuts fused together with the sugar. Add the walnuts to the pan.\nToss the pan around now with the walnuts, just to soften the hard or sharp sugar. I cook this for about a minute and then add the peas. Toss with the peas quickly, add the hoisin and sesame oil and turn off the heat. Give the pan one more good stir and then plate the dish."

Break the Japanese curry cubes into small blocks and add them to the pot. Stir gently to blend into the curry gravy.\n4.  Reduce the heat to low, place a lid on the pot cook for 7-8 minutes or until the curry roux is completely incorporated. Stir occasionally as the curry tends to stick to the bottom of the pot.\n5.

Use a meat mallet to pound the chicken thighs so they are 1/4 inch thick. Season with salt and pepper on both sides.\n2.  Place flour, egg and breadcrumbs into separate shallow bowls or plates.\n3.  Working one chicken thigh at a time, coat a fillet with flour, shake off excess, run it through the egg, allow excess to drip off, then transfer to the panko crumbs and cover on all sides. Repeat for all 4 chicken thighs.\n4.  Heat oil in a wok or deep skillet to 350\u00b0F. The amount of oil should be about 1\u00bc\u201d deep.\n5.  Gently place a fillet into the hot oil.

Add 2 diced shallots and fry until they start to brown.\n2.\nTurn up the heat and add 400g of diced chicken thighs to the pan. Sear the meat until browned on all sides.\n3.\nAdd 1 teaspoon each of ground cumin and ground coriander, along with 2 sliced carrots. Mix everything together and cook for 2 more minutes.\n4.\nAdd 4 tablespoons of Thai red curry paste, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 400g of halved waxy potatoes to the pan. Pour in 400ml of coconut milk and add 2 tablespoons of peanut butter, 7 cardamom pods, 1 cinnamon stick, a pinch of nutmeg, and 2 finely sliced Kaffir lime leaves. Mix everything together until the peanut butter is fully incorporated. Cover the pan with a lid and let everything simmer for around 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n5.\nServe the curry over jasmine rice and top with toasted peanuts, fresh coriander, and a drizzle of lime juice.\n\u200b\nCooking Tips for Massaman Curry:\nUse high-quality ingredients - Massaman curry relies on the flavour of the curry paste, so make sure to use a good-quality one.\nToast the spices - Toasting the spices, such as cinnamon, cumin, and coriander, before adding them to the curry will enhance their flavour and aroma.\nBrown the meat - If you're using meat, such as beef or chicken, brown it first to seal in the juices and enhance the flavour.\nUse coconut cream - Coconut cream is richer and thicker than coconut milk, and it gives the curry a creamy texture and flavour.\nAdd peanuts - Traditional massaman curry often includes peanuts, which add a crunchy texture and nutty flavour to the dish. You can also use cashews or almonds.\nDon't overcook the vegetables - To retain their texture and nutrients, don't overcook the vegetables. Add them towards the end of cooking and cook just until they're tender.\nAdjust the seasoning - Taste the curry as you cook it and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may need to add more salt, sugar, or fish sauce to balance the flavours."

It also rises more quickly than active dry yeast.\n2: Use baking soda in warm or even boiling water: Pretzel bites in water with baking soda is what gives them their distinctive flavor and texture. The baking soda causes a chemical reaction that creates a crispy crust on the outside of the pretzels.\nUse parchment paper: Use parchment paper to line your baking sheet to prevent the pretzel bites from sticking.\nBrush with butter: Once the pretzel bites are baked, brush them with melted butter and roll them in sugar. This will give them a delicious sweet and salty flavor.\nEnjoy warm: Sugar pretzel bites are best enjoyed warm, straight out of the oven. If you have leftovers, you can reheat them in the microwave for a few seconds."

This is my wife's favourite lasagna recipe and hopefully you'll like it too.\nIf you're interested, you can watch the\ninstructional video here\n\u200b\nIngredients\nFor the ragu:\n2 tbsp olive oil\n1 onion (finely chopped)\n1 carrot (finely chopped)\n1 stick of celery (finely chopped)\n750g beef mince\n130g pancetta (cut into small cubes)\n2 cloves of garlic\n1 beef stock cube / pot (dissolved in a little hot water)\n1 sprig of rosemary (leaves picked and finely chopped)\n1 glass white wine\n1 can chopped tomatoes\n2 tbsp tomato puree / paste\nFor the B\u00e9chamel\n1L full fat milk\n1 bay leaf\n75g butter\n125g flour\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1 Nutmeg grated (to taste)\n2 egg yolks\n100g parmesan cheese\nFor the layers\n12 lasagna sheets (softened for 20 seconds in hot water)\n50g parmesan\n\u200b\nInstructions\nFor the ragu:\nHeat the oil in a large pan and then add the vegetables and leave to fry for 5 minutes until softened and beginning to colour.\nAdd the mince and pancetta and fry for a minute or two then add the garlic, stock and rosemary and cook until the meat has browned on all sides.\nAdd the white wine and simmer until slightly reduced before adding the tomatoes and tomato puree.\nLeave to simmer either on a low heat on the hob or in a preheated over at 160C for at least 1.5-2 hours.\nFor the b\u00e9chamel:\nheat the milk and bay leaf until it begins to simmer and then remove from the heat and set aside.\nIn a separate pan, melt the butter over a medium heat and then add the flour to make a roux then add the milk (slowly at first) whilst stirring constantly.\nWhen you've added all of the milk, continue to stir over heat for about 15 minutes until the sauce becomes really thick.\nRemove the bay leaf, season with black pepper and grate in the nutmeg to taste - I like to give it a really good grating.\nMix in the egg yolks, then parmesan and remove from the heat and allow to cool.\nFor the layers\nGrease a square baking dish (mine was 26x26cm) and add two sheets of lasagna.\nCover the lasagna with a layer of ragu and then cover that with a layer of b\u00e9chamel.\nRepeat the process until you're out of ragu. If you've got the thicknesses right then you should have enough for 4 decent layers.\nTop with a final layer of pasta, b\u00e9chamel and then sprinkle over the remaining cheese.\nBake in a fan oven at 160C for 45-55 minutes until the cheese is bubbling and golden brown\n\u200b\nTips\nYou might want to turn the temperature up to 200C if its not cooked in 55 minutes to get the golden brown top but keep an eye on it because it will turn quickly. Don't turn the temperature up before then of the top will burn before the middle is cooked.\nThe longer you leave the ragu to simmer the better it will taste. Aim for 3 hours if you have time.\nYou can make any stage of the lasagna a day in advance, or make the lasagna and refrigerate overnight before cooking - the flavours will only develop more the longer you leave it.\nTastes great reheated or even cold as leftovers too.\nEdit: egg yolks added to ingredients and step 5 of Bechamel sauce"

You may also add some cream sauce and lingonberry jam. I hope you enjoy. =)\nIngredients for meatballs\n1 onion\n0.5 cup milk\n0.5 cup breadcrumbs mix\n1 egg\n2 tbsp beef stock\n1 tsp dijon mustard\n1 tbsp olive oil\n3 tbsp butter\n1 lb minced meat\n0.5 tsp salt\n2 dashes black pepper\n2 dashes allspice, ground\nBut hold on, mister. What kind of meat should I choose for meatballs? Good question my dear fellow human being. If you want juicy meatballs you should go 50/50 or 70/30 with beef/pork ratio. You could go 100% either way. If you\u2019re going with 100% beef you HAVE to use breadcrumb, milk and/or cooking cream in the mixture to make it juicy. 100% pork, well, that will become incredibly fatty. This recipe is made with 100% beef.\nIngredients for mashed potatoes\n2 lb potatoes\n1 cup of milk\n3 tbsp cooking cream\n1 dash of salt\n1 dash of black pepper\nIngredients for pickled cucumber\n1 cucumber\n1 cup water\n10 tbsp sugar\n10 tbsp white vinegar 12%\nHow-to:\nStart with the pickled cucumber. It has to sit for an hour before it\u2019s ready. While the pickled cucumber is on hold, you can start preparing for the main dish. As well as the mashed potatoes.\nCut the cucumber into thin slices.\nBring the water, white vinegar, and sugar to a boil.\nLet it cool, then pour it on top of the cucumber.\nLet it rest for one hour.\nContinue with the mashed potatoes.\nPeel and dice the potatoes into even pieces. This will decrease the amount of time needed to be boiled.\nBoil potatoes until soft all the way through. 10-15 minutes depending on the size of the potatoes.\nMash the potatoes. This is most efficiently done with a potato press.\nHeat up cooking cream with milk. Add to the mashed potatoes.\nDuring the boiling of the potatoes, it\u2019s a good idea to start with the meatballs.\nPeel and mince onion. Fry in 2 tbsp of butter until soft.\nMix breadcrumbs, milk, beef stock, mustard, and egg. Let swell for 5 min.\nAdd the minced meat and onion together with all the spices.\nEvenly mix it all together.\nRoll into medium-large meatballs. Fry in remaining butter and oil for 5-6 min.\nCream sauce (optional)\nBring 1 and a quarter cup of cooking cream, 2 tbsp of beef stock, and 1 tsp of soy sauce to a boil. While boiling, add and stir 1 tbsp of corn starch.\nBoil while stirring for 5 minutes. If the sauce is too thin, add some corn starch. Too thick, add some cream. Finnish it by seasoning with salt and pepper.\nTips for making good meatballs\nDon\u2019t handle the meat excessively. Neither when mixing the meat nor when rolling the meat into meatballs. This squeezes out fat resulting in dryer meatballs.\nRoll meatballs with oily/buttery hands. It makes it easier.\nThere you go! Serve it with a side dish of lingonberry jam and you will have a complete meal! Smaklig m\u00e5ltid"

Season to your taste. Bread your chicken strips by tossing them in the flour, then coating in the egg, then coating in your bread crumbs.\nTake your breaded strips and air fry (or regular fry) for 10-12 minutes @ 400F. Set aside in a warm place once they're done cooking.\nGo ahead and cook your pasta according to the boxed instructions. Salt your pasta water. I personally cook them slightly under as they will continue cooking in the sauce & when we bake our mac. Set aside 1/4 cup of your salted pasta water, strain.\nTo make the cheese sauce, begin by melting your butter in a large oven safe pan. Once melted, add your flour. Mix until lumpy. Looks gross, but the butter flour lumps mean you're doing it right! Pour in your pasta water, Franks & milk, stir to combine until smooth.\nOnce smooth, add your cheeses. Reserve roughly 1 cup of cheese, this will be baked on top. Stir until silky and velvety, then mix in your cooked pasta.\nOnce pasta and cheese is combined harmoniously, top with additional breadcrumbs and the remainder of cheese. Broil in the oven for 2-4 minutes, keeping a close eye on it. Remove once surface is a nice golden brown.\nBack to your chicken tenders, chop them up and toss them in Franks Red Hot. Add your ranch drizzle, an additional Franks drizzle, and top with your coated chopped chicken. Top with green onions.\nEnjoy and be ready for a food coma afterwards.\n\u200b\nRecipe video here, if you'd like to support our channel. Cheers!"

They're slightly crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside with a beautiful brown exterior.  It's the perfect finger food for a party, or game night, or family movie night.  With the Super Bowl coming up, it's the perfect potluck snack.\nPrep Time: 1 hour 30 minutes (1 hour proofing)\nCooking: 25 minutes (baking and boiling)\nServings: 12 Pretzels\nWe created a tutorial video if you are interested to see the recipe come alive or if you're more of a visual learner:\nBavarian Ballpark Pretzels\nIngredients:\n3 1/2 Cups of Bread Flour\n1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees)\n2 Tbsp neutral vegetable Oil\n2 tablespoons packed brown sugar\n1 Packet of Innstant or rapid-rise yeast (2 1/2 Tsp)\n4 Tsp Kosher salt + and extra to sprinkle on top\n1/2 cup baking soda\nDirections:\nIn the bowl of the stand mixer, combine water, yeast, oil and sugar.  Whisk the mixture, and let is stand for 3-5 minutes.\nOnce the yeast has activated, add flour and 4 Tsp of salt to the stand mixer bowl.  Using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed for 5 minutes until the dough detaches from the sides.\nTurn out the dough onto a work surface that's lightly coated with flour, and knead for a minute to form a dough ball.\nPlace the dough ball into a lightly oil coated bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow it to proof at room temperature for 1 hour, should double in size.Once the dough has doubled in size, deflate the dough gently and extract it from the bowl to a work surface.  Cut the dough into 12 even pieces.  Cover the pieces to prevent drying.\nLightly flour a baking sheet.  Take a 1 of the 12 pieces of dough, and roll it into a 20\"-24\" string, then lay it down into a u-shape.  Take two ends of the U, and cross them twice, and then fold them towards the bottom of the U and press the ends to the sides of the U.  This forms the pretzel.  Transfer the  pretzel to the floured baking sheet to rise for 20 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 C) Bring 8 cups of water to a boil, and add the baking soda.  Boil each pretzel into the baking soda for 30 seconds total, 15 seconds for each side.  Once boiled, transfer to a cooling rack and allow the pretzel to rest for 5 minutes.\nWipe the flour from the baking sheet, and oil with 1-2 Tbsp of oil.  Sprinkle the baking sheet with salt.  Transfer all boiled pretzels to the baking sheet.  Sprinkle additional salt on top of pretzels before baking.\nPlace the baking sheet into the oven on middle rack for one sheet at a time, and upper middle and lower middle for two baking sheets at a time.  For two baking sheets at a time, switch and rotate the sheets half-way through the baking time.  Bake for 15-20 minutes until pretzels are dark brown.\nOnce baked, remove the pretzels from the baking sheet to a cooling rack, and allow to cool for 10 minutes.\nNotes:\nOnce you've mastered this recipe, you can modify it for interesting and tasty variations.  Switch up the recipe, and try a different type of sugar (molasses, maple syrup etc), instead of oil try melted butter or ghee.\nYou can also make these in batches, and store them in the freezer for later, just thaw them out and heat them up at 300 F for 5 minutes in the oven, or in the air fryer."

The frying will fill out any imperfections as the bubbles fill it up\ncinnamon sugar really is the easiest topping and really warms you up too!

Rest for at least 30 minutes. Divide into balls of around 40-50g.\nPut each ball between 2 sheets of plastic wrap (or just use a ziplock cut into 2 pieces like I did), and press them in a tortilla press (which I didn\u2019t have) or just use a rolling pin. They should be very thin.\nHeat up a skillet until very hot and cook the tortillas for around a minute on each side. Keep them wrapped in a towel until ready to use so they keep warm and don\u2019t dry out.\nFor the jackfruit: start by saut\u00e9ing the white onion with some vegetable oil. After 3-4 minutes add the garlic. After a minute - add the paprika, cumin and salt. Cook for another 30 seconds, then add the jackfruit, tomatoes and stock along with some sugar.\nSimmer for 15 minutes, then smash the jackfruit with a potato masher. Cook for another 15 minutes until the liquid reduces and you get a pulled pork consistency.\nGarnish with avocado slices, pickled red onion, cilantro lime juice, and optionally some hot sauce. I just blended a can of chipotles in adobo until smooth.\nDidn\u2019t want to include this in the recipe per se, but for a quick pickled onion - just slice an onion, add the juice of half a lime, some salt and sugar, mix well and let sit for 30 minutes or so.\nYou could surely use store bought tortillas - haven\u2019t found any that I like where I live, so I just prefer to make my own.\nEnjoy!\nPreparation video:\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/dD3iWaJ64jU?feature=share"

Set aside.\nWhisk egg yolks along with 12 grams of sugar. Add oil and mix until well-combined. Then add milk and mix well.\nSieve in the flour in two batches. Mix after each addition until the batter is smooth. Mix in the diluted cocoa. Set aside.\nBeat egg white until frothy with an electric mixer running at high speed. Then gradually add sugar as you mix. Continue beating until it almost reaches stiff peak consistency.\nMix in 1/4 of beaten egg white into the cake batter using a spatula or a hand whisk. Then add another 1/4 of egg white. From here on, we want to gently combine the mixture. Be careful not to deflate the batter. Again, mix in another 1/4 portion. Add the remaining egg white. Mix just until no white streaks are seen.\nPour batter into an 11-inches (28 cm) square pan that has been lined with parchment paper. Spread the batter evenly. Tap the pan twice onto the counter to remove air bubbles.\nBake in a preheated oven at 285\u00b0F (140\u00b0C) for 20 minutes, then increase to 320\u00b0F (160\u00b0C) and continue baking for 15 minutes. Once baked, remove the cake from its pan and let cool completely.\nButtercream\nBeat the softened butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add condensed milk and mix just until combined.\nAssembly\nCut and divide the cake equally into two. Spread the buttercream over one piece of the cake. Cover it with the other piece to make a sandwich.\n[Optional] Trim all four sides of the cake with a serrated knife to get clean-cut edges.\nDivide the cake equally into three rectangular pieces. Then cut each piece diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner to get triangular cake slices."

Turn and cook until shrimp are pink on the other side and no longer translucent in the middle, about 1 to 2 minutes longer. Remove the shrimp to a plate and set aside.\nIf the pan looks dry, add another tablespoon olive oil. Add the shallots and cook, stirring often, until they begin to soften, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until soft and fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine and bring to a boil. Let the simmer for 1 minute; add the rest of the butter and swirl and stir the pan until the butter melts. Stir in the lemon zest, lemon juice and parsley.

        "top_comment": "Crispy Chicken Burger\nFor full recipe, tips, tricks, and Q&A, visit:\nhttps://maplewoodroad.com/food/crispy-chicken-burger/\nINGREDIENTS\nGeneral\nTwo 12-oz chicken breasts, halved\n4 brioche buns\n4 slices American cheese\n1 c cole slaw\n1 Tbsp butter\nVegetable oil for frying\nMarinade (wet mix)\n1-1/2 c buttermilk\n1 Tbsp hot sauce\n1 tsp paprika\n1 tsp onion powder\n1 tsp garlic powder\n1 tsp kosher salt\n1 tsp black pepper\nBatter (dry mix)\n1-1/2 c all-purpose flour\n2 Tbsp paprika\n1 tsp baking powder\n1 tsp cayenne pepper\n1 tsp onion powder\n1 tsp garlic powder\n1 tsp oregano\n1 tsp kosher salt\n1 tsp black pepper\nINSTRUCTIONS\nPlace the chicken on a large cutting board and dry them with a paper towel.\nNext, place plastic wrap over the chicken breast and, using a rolling pin, start pounding the thickest part of the breast, working your way around until you achieve an even thickness (about \u00bd\u201d). You\u2019ll also end up with a larger piece of meat.\nCut in half (each 12-oz chicken breast will result in two 6-oz crispy fried chicken sandwiches).\nSeason the chicken breasts with paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, kosher salt, and black pepper.\nPour the buttermilk into a mixing bowl and add the hot sauce. Stir.\nAdd the seasoned chicken to the bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and marinate in the fridge for a minimum of two hours, ideally overnight.\nImportant: Make sure to remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before dredging and frying them. Once I forgot and went ahead anyway. The result was as expected. When the chicken was perfectly fried on the outside, the internal temperature of the chicken was at a paltry 130\u00b0F. By the time it reached 160\u00b0F, the outside didn\u2019t look so golden crispy anymore.\nIn a mixing bowl, mix the all-purpose flour, paprika, baking powder, cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, kosher salt, and black pepper. Mix well. Do not dredge the chicken yet. Instead, wait until the oil is ready (see next step).\nIn a large enough frying pan to accommodate at least two halved chicken breasts, add enough oil to cover the bottom about \u00be\u201d deep.\nCarefully bring the temperature up to 350\u00b0F, checking with an instant-read thermometer.\nOnce your oil reaches 350\u00b0F, lift a piece of chicken from the buttermilk and allow the excess to drip off a little, then place it in the flour and spice mixture. This dry mix must reach every nook and cranny of the meat to achieve a perfect crispy outside. Use your fingers to coat the chicken breast evenly. Gently shake off the excess batter and carefully lower it into the hot oil.\nFry for about four minutes, turn, and fry for another four minutes. Use your instant-read thermometer to make sure the internal temperature of the chicken has reached 160\u00b0F.\nIn the meantime, have a cooling rack ready with a paper towel underneath. Once the chicken is at 160\u00b0F, remove with tongs and place on the cooling rack.\nWhile the fried crispy chicken is resting on the cooling rack, butter up some brioche buns, add a slice of American cheese, and lightly toast in the toaster oven. Remove, add some coleslaw and a piece of chicken breast. Enjoy!"

In a pinch, you can soak them in just-boiled water for at least an hour. You want them to be quite plump, and they should more than double in size, so make sure you\u2019ve got enough room in your bowl for their expansion. In terms of salt-to-chickpea ratios, you\u2019ll want to add to the water\nup to 3/4 tsp of fine salt\n(that\u2019s 3.7mL, if you\u2019re feeling precise)\nper cup of dried chickpeas\n(roughly 240mL).\nWhen ready to bake, preheat oven to 210\u00b0C (410\u00b0F). Drain your chickpeas well, give \u2019em a little shake to get rid of more water, and spread them out evenly on a large baking sheet \u2013 taking care to avoid too many of the chickpeas touching one another.\nYou can rub your chickpeas very sparingly with\nolive oil\nand sprinkle them lightly with\nsalt\nprior to baking, but this isn\u2019t absolutely necessary. Dry roasting also works well.\nPut the tray in the centre of the oven, bake for 10 minutes, then turn the heat down to 190\u00b0C (375\u00b0F) and let bake for a further 15 minutes, until they are a deep golden colour.\nWhile still hot, thinly coat the chickpeas in\nolive oil\nso any seasoning you choose to sprinkle on them will stick. Sprinkle from high above for better distribution, and roll the chickpeas around to ensure even coating. Start with a small amount, taste a chickpea, and adjust your seasoning (you can always add more, but you can't take it away). Personally, I find\nsalt\n,\ngarlic powder\nand\nsmoked chipotle\nto be an absolutely delicious (and uncomplicated) combination.\n\u200b\nnotes\nOven temperatures can vary quite a bit, but keeping an ear out for your chickpeas will help you determine whether the temperature is right \u2014  if a few chickpeas occasionally pop here and there, you\u2019re okay. If they start exploding all over the place, turn the heat down!

        "top_comment": "Classic Hainanese Chicken Rice made \"hawker-style\"! Gently poached chicken that is dressed in a sweet soy sauce and served with a side of tangy, spicy hot sauce. The rice is to die for! Jasmine rice is cooked with the chicken poaching liquid, chicken fat, pandan leaves, garlic, and shallots.\nYou'll ask for 2nds and 3rds of just the rice alone! Here is the\nstep-by-step video tutorial\n\u200b\nIngredients - 4-5 Servings\n3 - 4 lb Whole Chicken\n4 Spring Onions\n1\" Knob Ginger\nUnsalted Chicken Stock or Water (I highly recommend you use pre-made chicken stock!)*Enough to cover the chicken. It's ok if the chicken isn't fully submerged. The steam will cook the chicken breasts.\n20g Kosher Salt per Liter of Chicken Stock/Water + 1/2 tsp msg per Liter if using water.\n\u200b\nBRINE:\n1/3 Cup Kosher Salt\nWater to Rinse\nBoiling Water to tighten the skin\n\u200b\nRICE:\n3 Cups Jasmine Rice\n4 TBSP Chicken Fat\n8 Garlic Cloves (bashed)\n2 Large Shallots (roughly chopped)\n1/2\" Knob Ginger (thick slices)\n3 Cups + 6 TBSP Chicken Broth (from cooking chicken) *1 cup + 2 tbsp for every 1 cup of rice\nA bundle of Pandan Leaves\n\u200b\nSOY DRESSING:\n1/4 Cup Light Soy Sauce\n2 TSP Sesame Oil\n1 TBSP Rendered Chicken Fat\n1 TSP Sugar\n\u200b\nCHILI SAUCE:\n6 Red Chilies (de-seeded) *Control the spice level by leaving in the seeds or adding a few bird's eye chilis (3:2 ratio)\n1\" Knob of Ginger\n8 Garlic Cloves\n1 TSP White Vinegar\n3 TBSP Tangerine Juice (1 tangerine)\nPinch of Kosher Salt\n2 TBSP Chicken Broth (from cooking chicken)\n1 TSP Sugar\n\u200b\nInstructions\nRub the chicken with kosher salt until the skin is smooth and slippery.\nRinse the salt off with water.\nCut off any chicken fat located around the butt & neck areas. Set aside for the rice and soy dressing.\nIf you're not using a giant pot to cook the chicken, boil a kettle of water and slowly pour it all over the chicken and into the cavity.\nThis process will tighten the chicken skin and will help us create that gelatinized skin we all love in Hainanese chicken.\nStuff the chicken cavity with a bunch of spring onions and ginger.\nIf you're using a big pot, you can simply bring the pot of chicken stock/water to a boil and dip the chicken in a few times before fully submerging.\nI used a pot that was just big enough to fit a 3.5lb chicken which only required ~3 cups of liquid.\nMake sure the liquid is boiling before you fully submerge the chicken.\nCover the pot with a lid, bring it back up to a boil, turn the heat down to a bare simmer, and cook for 30-35 minutes.\nA 3-3.5 lb chicken will take 30-35 minutes, 3.5-4.5 lb chicken ~35-40 minutes.\nPrepare an ice bath.\nTo see if the chicken is done cooking, cut into the thickest part of the thigh.\nIf the juices run clear, the chicken is ready. If there is still blood, it'll need a few more minutes.\nSubmerge the cooked chicken into an ice bath for at least 15 minutes, rotating every few minutes if it's not fully submerged.\nThis will stop the cooking process and is the final step to creating the gelatinized chicken skin!\nDrain on a wire rack and lightly brush on some sesame oil.\nServe at room temperature. You can reheat it for 1-2 minutes but run the risk of drying out the meat.\nWash and drain the Jasmine rice.\nRender out the 4 tbsp of chicken fat until the solids become nice and crispy.\nIf you don't have enough chicken fat, add some sesame oil and vegetable oil.\nPan-fry the ginger, garlic, and shallots until fragrant. 1-2 minutes.\nSome recipes call for pan-frying the rice too but it's not necessary if you thoroughly mix the rice later.\nAdd 3 Cups + 6 TBSP of the chicken broth to the rice. We're using the chicken broth we cooked the chicken in!\nThe broth should be seasoned enough that you don't need to add any more salt to the rice.\nAdd the aromatics & oils to the rice and mix thoroughly.\nAdd a bundle of pandan leaves.\nCook according to rice cooker instructions.\nRemove all the aromatics and give the rice a mix to fluff it up. Keep warm.\nBlend all the chili sauce ingredients together until smooth. Set aside.\nCalamansi is normally used instead of tangerine juice but it's not commonly found here in the states.\nCombine the soy dressing ingredients. Set aside.\nRemove the wings and thighs from the chicken.\nChop off the back and carefully remove the breast bones.\nChop into bite-sized pieces.\nServe on top of a bed of cucumbers.\nSpoon on some soy dressing.\nGarnish with spring onions.\nServe with a bowl of chicken rice and a side of chili sauce."

Keep notes as to the proportion and ingredients you use so you can learn how to adjust. Having said that, the basic ratio is 1 - 2 percent konbu and katsuo to water (I have a chef friend who uses 3% katsuo, so there's a lot of personal preference involved).\nIngredients\n1000ml water\n10-20 grams konbu (dried kelp)\n10-20 grams katsuo flake (bonito flakes)\nDirections\nSoak the konbu over night, but no more than 24 hours or the water becomes 'slimy'. Remove the konbu and when you're ready, proceed to step two.\nHeat that water to the simmer and add your katsuo flakes. Keep the water under the boil and cook for no more than two minutes (if and when the katsuo sinks to the bottom of the pan, that's the sign the dashi is finished).\nStrain through a fine mesh sieve, paper towel, or coffee filter to remove any particulate (for the clearest possible soup) -- do not press the solids.\nNow you have dashi.\nTo make 'soup' for osumono (Japanese seasonal soups)\nIngredients\n1 teaspoon light soy sauce\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n400ml of the dashi\nDirections\nadd the salt and soy sauce to the dashi and bring to a simmer.

Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.\n5. Bake for 25 minutes. Rotate the pan in the oven and bake for 25 more minutes. Remove from oven and let cook for at least 20 mins. Then turn the cake out onto a clean plate, remove the parchment, and turn the cake back over onto a wire rack. Let the cake cool completely.\n6. Place the  chocolate chips into a bowl and set aside.\n7.Heat the heavy cream in a quart-sized,\nmicrowavable container and microwave for 3 to 4 minutes on high, or heat on stovetop medium heat until it just begins to simmer. Pour the cream over the chocolate chocolate chips and let stand for 2 minutes. Mix until smooth and pour over cooled cake. Let ganache set for at least 15 mins. Slice and serve!\nIf you\u2019d like to watch me make this cake, you can check it out\nhere!"

Meat Sauce\n-  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n-  3 large carrots, peeled\n&\nfinely chopped\n-  1 large onion, diced\n-  4 large cloves garlic, minced\n-  1 green bell pepper, diced\n-  16 ounces lean ground beef\n-  8 ounces ground pork\n-  \u00be cup red wine\n-  2 cans, or fresh (28 ounces) diced tomatoes\n- 1 tablespoon tomato paste\n- 1/2 tablespoon ketchup\n-  Course kosher salt (Diamond Crystal Brand) and fresh, or dried, Italian herbs (oregano, rosemary, thyme).\nINSTRUCTIONS\nIn a 10 or 12 inch heavy-bottomed stainless steel or cast-iron skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until sufficiently pre-heated. Add onion and carrots, season slightly with a healthy pinch of kosher salt. Saut\u00e9 until translucent, about 8 minutes.\nAdd garlic and bell pepper. Continue cooking until garlic is fragrant but not scorched.\nIncrease heat to high. Add beef and pork and cook, breaking apart the meat with a wooden spoon until mostly browned. Approximately 10 minutes.\nAdd wine and deglaze. Boil off the wine until it is mostly evaporated, 3-4 minutes at least.\nStir in tomatoes with all liquid if using canned. Reheat to boiling and then reduce heat to medium-low.\nAdd ketchup and tomato paste\nSeason with more salt and select italian herbs to your liking.\nSimmer the now mostly completed sauce, uncovered, for at least 20 minutes or until the sauce has thickened sufficiently.\nPreheat oven to 375.\nB. B\u00e9chamel\n-  Metal whisk\n-  2 tablespoons butter\n-  3 tablespoons flour\n-  2 cups of milk, heated to just under a boil\n-  Salt and white pepper\nINSTRUCTIONS\nIn a 2 or 3 quart saucepan, melt butter over low heat.\nOnce butter is completely melted and covering the bottom of your saucepan, blend in the flour by small amounts, stirring frequently with whisk.\nOnce all flour is blended in, continue cooking for 2 minutes without browning or coloring the mixture.\nRemove from heat. Allow to slightly cool and then pour in the heated milk in one swift motion. Immediately and quickly blend the mixture together with whisk.\nReturn saucepan to the stove over medium-high heat and continue stirring quickly until the sauce comes to boil.\nBoil for about 1 minute, while stirring, until sauce is thick enough to coat and cling to the back of a spoon.\nRemove from heat and season slightly with kosher salt and white pepper. Careful not to over-season as to avoid overpowering the dish.\nIf sauce is too thin, boil it down while stirring continually until reduced and thickened. If sauce is too thick, simmer and thin out with milk added in a tablespoon at a time. If sauce is lumpy, either strain or blend it and then simmer for a few minutes.\nC. Filling\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-  1-2 cups freshly made b\u00e9chamel\n-  7 ounces, approximate, ricotta cheese\n-  1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese.\nIn roughly equal parts, combine all ingredients, stir well, and taste.\nReserve some parmesan to both top unbaked lasagna and garnish completed lasagna.\nD. Assembly\nINSTRUCTIONS\n-  1 package (8 to 9 ounces) of no-boil lasagna noodles.\nIn the bottom of a 13x9 baking dish, ladle about 1 cup of meat sauce to evenly coat the bottom of the dish.\nArrange 3-4 (depending on width of noodles) noodles over sauce, careful not to overlap or touch sides of the dish.\nLadle 1 \u00bd cups meat sauce over noodles.\nSpread about \u00be - 1 cup of filling over meat sauce. Best method is to use a tablespoon, dropping dollops across the layer and then spreading slightly. The filling will loosen while cooking so it does not have to be perfect.\nRepeat steps 2-4 with all remaining ingredients until you finish with a final layer of meat sauce.\nTop assembled lasagna with filling and freshly grated parmesan.\nCover with foil and bake 30 minutes in preheated oven at 375.\nRemove foil and bake for 15 additional minutes.\nRemove dish from the oven and raise oven rack to the highest position. Set broiler to high and place uncovered lasagna on topmost rack directly under heat elements. Broil carefully, with over door ajar, until the top is perfectly crisped and brown.\nTurn off heat, remove from oven and rest for a minimum of 15 minutes.\nWith a serrated knife, divide lasagna into equal portions and guide your cuts by the small gaps between noodles.\nServe garnished with fresh chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese. Pair with peperoncinis and the rest of that bottle of red wine."

Add one ladle of stock at a time and stir. Adjust the heat so it\u2019s barely boiling. Just a couple bubbles here and there.\nOnce the liquid is absorbed, add another ladle of stock, stir, and repeat. Watch, smell, and taste. From adding the first ladle to the last, it takes about 25 minutes from start to finish. Taste, but be careful with adding salt too soon. The stock will add additional salt, and so will the salty Parmigiano Reggiano.\nWhen the rice is done, add (at least) 1 Tbsp butter and (at least) 1/2 c of Parmigiano Reggiano (the good stuff). Stir for about 2 minutes and add a couple cranks of black pepper (1/4 tsp).\nMushroom Risotto\nHeat 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.\nAdd 1/4 c chopped shallots and cook for 2 minutes until translucent.\nAdd 8 oz sliced mushrooms, 1 Tbsp minced garlic, 1 tsp dry thyme and/or sage, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, and season with 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper. Stir occasionally and cook (simmer) for about 8 minutes.\nOnce the mushrooms have absorbed all the liquids, taste them and add more salt if necessary. Remove from the saucepan and set aside.\nNext, cook the risotto as outlined in the Basic Risotto recipe above.\nOnce the risotto is ready in its creamy deliciousness, put the cooked mushrooms back in the risotto and stir it all together.\nSprinkle with some roughly chopped fresh flat-leaf Italian parsley and pour yourself a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. You deserve it."

        "top_comment": "Excited to share a dish I grew up with!\nThe salmon is a super easy weeknight recipe that\u2019s ready in under 25 minutes, and the sauce is something my parents always have a stash of in their fridge, since it pairs well with a ton of different dishes.\nHere's the\nvideo\nfor a walkthrough.\nSourcing Salmon Sustainably\nFor this specific recipe, my parents bought Atlantic salmon. With regards to Atlantic vs Pacific, farmed or wild-caught, there\u2019s no right or wrong choice, but my parents have a slight preference for Atlantic salmon, which nowadays are primarily farmed.\nAs one of the world\u2019s most consumed species of fish, salmon is a massive industry, with several million tons sold every single year, and tons of complexity surrounding how we source it in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way.\nAs consumers, an easy way to do our part is by making sure we vote with our wallets. Monterey Bay Aquarium in California runs a free website and mobile app called \"Seafood Watch\" which has a ton of recommendations on how to choose and purchase seafood in ways that have the least environmental impact.\nSalmon + Chinese communities in the west\nAs I was researching this recipe, I felt like it was important to share how salmon and fishing helped form some of the first Chinese communities in the West.\nDuring the Gold Rush, tens of thousands of Chinese immigrants, mostly from Guangzhou, flocked to California enticed by the promise of the G\u0101m S\u0101an, or gold mountain in Cantonese, although many were forced out of mining work due to discrimination.\nUndeterred, a group of experienced fishermen found their own gold in abalone and other fish along the Monterey coast. Known as China Point by locals, Chinese immigrants proudly sparked the first large scale commercial fishing industry in California, supplying fish and shellfish to countries all over the world.\nDuring and after the Gold Rush and the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, many Chinese immigrants relocated to Seattle, Vancouver, and surrounding areas to work for salmon canneries and on fishing boats, doing the difficult work of supplying and processing most of the world\u2019s salmon at the time.\nToday, the once thriving Chinese enclave in Monterey no longer exists, but in spite of periods of intense discrimination and oppression, Seattle and Vancouver are still homes to some of the largest Chinese communities abroad.\nTHE RECIPE\nOverview\nPrep Time: 10 min\nTotal Time: 25 min\nYield: 4 servings\nIngredients for Salmon\n1.5 lb\nsalmon\n1\negg\nwhite pepper\n(to taste)\n3 tbsp\ncornstarch\n2 tbsp\ncorn oil\n0.50 tbsp\nrice cooking wine\ngarlic salt\n(to taste)\nDipping Sauce\n1 tbsp\nsugar\n0.50 tbsp\nvinegar\n2 tbsp\nlight soy sauce\n0.25 tsp\nchili sauce\n(to taste)\n2 tbsp\nboiling water\n(very important)\nOptional Garnish\ncilantro\nbroccoli\nStep 1 - Cut salmon\nThis is totally optional, but if you're planning on garnishing the salmon with anything (like cilantro) or serving it with any vegetables (like broccoli), then it's best to cut it before the salmon (for sanitation).\nTo make our\nsalmon\n(1.5 lb) fillets, make diagonal cuts about 2 cm apart. The diagonal cuts help increase the surface area of the fillets, which leads to a faster cook and less moisture loss.\nStep 2 - Coat salmon\nSpread the fillets out on the cutting board, and sprinkle\nwhite pepper\non each side. The white pepper helps counter some of the \"fishy\" taste of the salmon, which has a slightly negative connotation in Chinese cuisine.\nWe'll crack and mix our\negg(s)\n(1) into a bowl, and spread out\ncornstarch\n(3 tbsp) on a plate.\nCoat each side of each salmon fillet first in the egg, and then the cornstarch. Make sure each side is evenly coated.\nThis coating helps the salmon retain its juices, and also add some delicious crunchy/crispiness when it's cooked.\nStep 3 - Cook salmon\nHeating the wok\nWe\u2019ll set our stove to medium high and let our wok heat up.\nUnlike other Chinese recipes, with salmon, it\u2019s important that the wok gets hot enough but not too hot. It\u2019s difficult to give an exact amount of time, since it depends a lot on your stove and cookware.\nMy dad relies on his own intuition that he\u2019s developed over 50 years of cooking. For the rest of us, he waited about 2-3 minutes on this current setup.\nCook the salmon\nThen, we\u2019ll add\ncorn oil\n(2 tbsp), and swirl it around the wok.\nThe wok and the oil should be hot enough once the oil starts shimmering, or making ripples.\nOnce this happens, we\u2019ll add our salmon to the wok.\nMy dad had just enough room for 8 fillets, so try not to overcrowd your wok and consider cooking in multiple batches if necessary.\nThe total cooking time for the salmon also varies depending on how hot your stove is, how thick each fillet is, and what type of pan or wok you\u2019re using.\nOn my dad\u2019s current setup, which has less heat output than a gas stove, he cooked each fillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, generally not flipping the salmon over more than once.\nFor a visual cue, once the salmon fillet starts to turn more white / yellow-ish, you can flip it.\nYou should be able to tell if the salmon is done if it easily flakes. If you wanted to get more precise, you can also insert an instant-read food thermometer into the thickest part of the salmon.\nOther tips\nAs long as it\u2019s cooked enough, the rest is just a lot of trial and error to find the texture of salmon that\u2019s perfect for you. My dad tends to prefer salmon that\u2019s more medium or well-done, so if you prefer something more rare, then adjust accordingly.\nKenji from the Food Lab has a great blog post and video with a bunch of helpful tips on how to pan fry salmon. Not all of these tips apply to this specific recipe, but it\u2019s still a great resource, and I\u2019ve linked to it in our description.\nStep 4 - Add flavors, cover wok\nAdd\ngarlic salt\nto the fillets.\nThen, we'll add\nrice cooking wine\n(0.50 tbsp). We should have the lid for the wok within reach, because we\u2019ll be covering the wok immediately after we pour the cooking wine in. We\u2019ll only be covering the wok for about 20 to 30 seconds before we take the lid off.\nStep 5 - Uncover, plate, garnish\nUncover the wok, and turn the heat off. Transfer the salmon fillets to a plate, and add any garnish you'd like.\nStep 6 - Create sauce\nTo make the sauce, mix together\nsugar\n(1 tbsp),\nvinegar\n(0.50 tbsp),\nlight soy sauce\n(2 tbsp),\nboiling water\n(2 tbsp), and\nchili sauce\n(0.25 tsp). Mix it all together for about 5-10 seconds.Notes:\nIf you prefer more spiciness, feel free to add more chili sauce.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why my dad specifically uses boiling water, it\u2019s to help extend the shelf life of the sauce. My parents elaborate on why during our \"Meal Time\".\n-------\nOur why\nI've always wanted to honor my parents and capture the hundreds of recipes that my dad's perfected over 50 years as a Chinese chef. I want to celebrate their legacy and epic journey of making something of themselves here in America, and pass it down to our kids.\nThanks for reading! Hope you all love the recipe :)"

        "top_comment": "I've never made anything with dough before, here is my version of the recipe I found:\nRecipe: Cinnamon Rolls\nIngredients\nDough\n1 cup whole milk warmed (105-140\u00b0)\n2 packages (or 5 teaspoons) active dry yeast\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n5 cups all-purpose flour separated (plus extra for rolling out the dough)\n3 large eggs room temperature\n1/2 cup unsalted butter room temperature, cut into chunks\n2 teaspoons fine sea salt\nFilling and Glaze(Egg wash)\n1 egg, room temperature, slightly beaten for sealing edge and egg wash on top\n3/4 cup firmly-packed light brown sugar\n2 tablespoon ground cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt\n1/3 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, separated\nIcing\n1 block Cream Cheese\n1 cup Powdered Sugar\n1 tbs unsalted butter\n1/8 tsp vanilla\nDirections\nGrow the yeast: Add the warmed milk to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment or just in a bowl. The milk should feel very warm to the touch, but not scalding hot. Use a thermometer to gauge exact temperature if desired. Sprinkle over the yeast, and stir to moisten. Allow to stand until foamy, about 5-7 minutes.\nMake the dough: Add sugar, 4 1/2 cups of flour, eggs, butter and salt to the yeast. Place remaining 1/2 cup of flour in a small bowl. Mix on low just until the contents of the stand mixer come together. Do not over mix. Double check to makes sure you have added all of the aforementioned ingredients before moving on to the kneading stage.\nKnead the Dough: I kneaded by hand for 10 minutes, adding in bits of the last of the flour as necessary. Here is from the recipe: Remove the paddle attachment and attach the dough hook. Knead the dough on low speed (e.g. speed 2 if using a KitchenAid\u00ae stand mixer), and continue to so for 5-7 minutes, adding in the reserved flour 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed, to prevent the dough from sticking to the sides of the bowl. Alternatively, knead the dough by hand.\nDough Rise: Have ready a large oiled bowl. Once the dough is properly kneaded, appearing smooth and elastic in texture, transfer to the oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap, and allow to proof in a warm, draft-free spot until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 - 2 hours.\nFilling:  Have ready a greased 9x13\u201d baking dish, and prepare the egg wash by beating together the egg with 1 tablespoon of water. Set aside until ready to use. To make the filling, in a small bowl, combine brown sugar, cinnamon and salt. Set aside until ready to use.\nRoll 'em out: Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cut in half with a sharp knife. Set one half aside, and begin working with the other. Lightly dust the dough with flour. Pat out the dough into the shape of a rectangle. Using a rolling pin dusted with flour, roll out the dough into a rectangle, measuring close to 12 x 14\u201d. Rotate the dough (if necessary) so that one of the short sides is in front of you.\nFill 'em: Spread half of the butter across the surface of the dough, stopping about 1\u201d from the short side opposite of you. Sprinkle with half of the cinnamon sugar mixture, and rub across with the butter, patting to adhere and taking care to leave cleared space at end for egg wash. Brush the clear area lightly with the egg wash. Set aside egg wash and reserve.\nRoll 'em up: Starting on the short side closest to you, begin rolling into a log. Once rolled, pinch together the seam and place seam-side down on your work surface. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut off the tapered ends and discard.\nCut Rolls: Cut the log into 6 equal pieces. Stagger the rolls evenly across half of the greased baking dish. Repeat with the remaining log, and proceed to fill the dish. You should have 12 cinnamon rolls total. I wasn't careful enough with forming, rolling out, or cutting, so I got 16 and cooked the ends also. Unflavored dental floss is best for cutting them, slide a piece underneath and wrap it around up to the top and cross the strings and pull.\nSecond Rise: Cover the rolls loosely with a kitchen towel, and allow them to rise in a warm, draft-free spot until they have doubled in size, about 40 minutes.\nBake: Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 350\u00b0. Brush the reserved egg mixture across the top of the cinnamon rolls. Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Set aside and allow to cool slightly.\nIcing: Whisk room temp icing ingredients until smooth. Pour across rolls and spread.\nInhale"
