        "body": "I'm so excited, I've worked at this for months and I finally got it. A gluten-free mochi donut that can properly dispense through a depositer.\nThis was a significant challenge as I was dealing with either dough that was too thick to properly dispense, or dough too runny to actually shape. When I finally did manage to get it to dispense, I was dealing with a lot of deflating. I finally figured it out last night and I'm euphoric as can be.\nTexture and taste wise, it's quite similar to Paris Baguette's mochi donuts. I haven't tried Mochinut, but my girlfriend has and she said our texture is close, but not quite there.\nRegardless, I'm so excited to be able to serve proper fried, yeast-raised gluten-free donuts to people who might not be able to eat regular donuts. My next step will be trying to make it vegan as well, so long as it doesn't compromise texture and taste.\nI'm grateful for anyone on reddit who has helped me along the way, you guys are the best! I also want to give a shout out to Katarina Cermelj for her amazing book, \"The Elements of Baking\", as that really started pushing me towards my breakthrough. The book is literally $1.99 on Kindle and I cannot recommend it enough.\nEdit: It seems the book isn't available for that price anymore? I just purchased it about two weeks ago, so that's very odd that the price jumped so much. I'm sorry for the misinformation, but I will say that regardless it's a very good purchase and worth it. I even purchased the hardcopy because I felt she deserved it.",

I would like to try to replicate it using olive oil instead of canola oil (I just looked it up, and the American version uses soybean oil; I\u2019m from Germany). I know how to make regular mayonnaise, but since this one is mostly water, I\u2019m unsure how to nail down the consistency.\nThe ingredients list xanthan gum and modified starch as thickeners. Does this mean I couldn\u2019t just use regular starch from the grocery store? I\u2019m not a food scientist, just someone who likes to cook. I think olive oil is healthier, so I\u2019d like to try making it. I don\u2019t want to mess up the first batch by making simple mistakes.\nDoes anyone have tips\u2014not only regarding the formula, but also on how to prepare the actual Miracle Whip\u2013type dip? I\u2019ve never worked with xanthan gum before. Regarding the starch, I plan on heating it in a pot with a bit of water and then adding the mixture to the other ingredients. I also plan not to use any egg, just for simplicity.\nThank you very much in advance, guys!",
        "top_comment": "\u201cModified starch\u201d can be a few different things. Sometimes, it\u2019s just pre-gelatinized, where it\u2019s cooked in some water to hydrate, then dried again (similar to instant grains). Others may be enzyme-modified, where an enzyme is used to increase chemical linkage inside the starch, e.g. maltodextrin. There are some other forms, too, but I know a US ingredient declaration won\u2019t tell you which type it is. Certain ones like the pre-gel may not need heat to work. Since it sounds like you\u2019re in Germany, does your label reference a specific E number? Chemically modified starches will have one, but enzymatically or physically modified starches will not, so that slightly narrows it down.\nRemember that this high-moisture item will have a pretty short shelf life without added preservatives.\nAnd I wouldnt\u2019t recommend using extra virgin olive oil when you do this (refined is fine). The high-shear blending can\nreally\namplify bitterness of the polyphenols in EVOO because all the tiny droplets mean major surface area exposed when you taste it (and I say this as someone who loves a punchy EVOO)."

As a result, discussions about flavor, tolerance, or \u201ccocoa\u2019s effects\u201d often conflate multiple variables.\nOne under-discussed variable is\nshell inclusion\n.\nCocoa shell differs chemically and structurally from nib. When shell presence varies \u2014 even at low levels \u2014 conclusions about cocoa itself become harder to interpret.\nMechanical shelling systems prioritize throughput and efficiency. Even when well-tuned, they accept a residual presence of shell micro-fragments in the nib fraction and compensate by tolerating some loss of cocoa fines. This is reasonable for production, but it means the shell is never fully eliminated as a variable.\nReference chocolate\nis chocolate produced under deliberately constrained conditions where shell is removed with maximal delicacy such that no shell material is intentionally or detectably present. At present, this is achievable only through manual shelling with continuous visual verification.\nThis is not a claim of superiority. Reference chocolate is:\nnot optimized for flavor\nnot scalable\nnot representative of commercial chocolate\nnot a health claim\nIts purpose is narrower: to serve as a baseline material against which other chocolates, processes, and claims can be meaningfully compared.\nI\u2019ve written a short, non-promotional processing definition here for anyone interested:\n[\nlink\nto PDF]\nHappy to hear where people agree or think this framing breaks.",

Why would I want to compare a new chocolate product with a representative idea of a chocolate versus a real chocolate product I will need to compete with?\nAlso surely there already are some \u201crepresentative\u201d (standard/reference) chocolates sold by the NIST for research and calibration purposes."

From what I can tell, possible next steps include getting into a lower-level job like QC and going from there, getting a master's degree (emphasizing the importance of connections made on the job and elsewhere), or perhaps some sort of certificate, though I don't know if that's necessarily helpful.\nAs for whether or not I'd enjoy the work, I've been fascinated with genetics/plant breeding for some time and while that might not factor in, there's certainly adjacent fields I might want to seek out, so if you know any, please let me know what sounds good! I tend to like the kind of work I can kind of just leave behind when I leave to go home, but research-type work isn't out of the question either. Histology's another option I'm eying for that reason, it's rather rote and I just need the one certification to get into the field. I'm still keeping my options open for now though, as that was the purpose I had in mind going for a general biology degree in the first place (though I'm now realizing that didn't really work out for me, I've been applying for jobs in all sorts of fields with no success and only about a dozen interviews). I'd also like to live outside the United States at some point, and while getting a master's outside of the country sounds like an expensive prospect, it's worth noting as I path out my future.\nIn summary, my options now are continuing to apply to low-level QC gigs and such or to get a master's (I'm thinking University of Minnesota looks good and I could probably get the tuition paid for through an assistantship).

So, covering fruit in syrup increases air-insulated contact points that should extract faster/more fully regardless of vacuum-sealing or not.\nBecause the process of inverting sugar creates a sweeter product than granulated sugar or simple/rich syrup, you need less but you'll still get enough yield in the end because theoretically it'd draw out more of the fruit's water content. So\nmaybe\nyou end up with a syrup that has more concentrated fruit flavour than sweetness.\nFruit syrups typically have shorter shelf lives bc of the extra particles introduced into the sugar, but invert sugar is much more concentrated due to the long boiling process needed to reach 236\u00b0F, so whatever extra water/particle content is introduced is going into an environment that is still more sugar-rich than a 2:1 rich syrup.\nCan folks help me dissect this theory?\nHave made fruit syrups this way twice, and damn, they tasted great. But I only want to do the extra step of inverting syrup (don't want to buy commercial invert when I already have the ingredients to make it) if there's solid science behind this method being more efficient than the traditional oleo saccharum method and not just in my head...",
        "top_comment": "Oleo saccharum is less about pulling moisture from the peels, and more about pulling the oils out. Oils aren't very polar, so it's possible that granulated sugar would have an edge over invert sugar because of the capillary action from the spaces between the sugar granuals pulling out oil.\nAlso try using alcohol, abrasion, or heat. Maybe you'll find a combination of methods that you like."

I am not a academic but worked for quite a few years at a cocoa processing plant.\nIt is overly simplistic to state that cocoa power is a byproduct of cocoa butter production. I would say pressing cocoa liquor produces two products cocoa powder and cocoa butter and cocoa butter is the more valuable product. Due to this difference in value companies will prioritize butter production over powder, for instance the standard amount of fat remaining in cocoa powder is 10-12% which was arrived at by the amount of butter you can reasonably extract from cocoa liquor.\nMy non-academic understanding of polyphenol content in cocoa is that fermentation, alkalization, and roasting all decrease polyphenol content. Also cocoa liquor is subjected to high temperatures and pressure during butter extraction. So it would be a reasonable assumption that polyphenol content is lower in cocoa powder than cocoa liquor all other factors being equal."

For me, AI trends (even AI slop), GLP-1 trends and policy trends generally trickle down to food. Generally, you can get a lot of inspiration from other consumer trends.

        "body": "If you don't actually know what's wrong with you or that a food is causing problems, how can you change it? If you're unaware that you're destroying your health, then what can be done? How do people become aware of health issues related to their diet, that they didn\u2019t know existed?\nThese three questions are the crux of what my research is trying to explore.\nHi everyone,\nA little shy of two weeks ago, I posted a survey in\nr/foodscience\noriginally titled \u201cHow Health Education Impacts Dietary Choices\u201d which I later changed to \u201cHow people\u2019s perception of health information influences dietary choices\u201d for the sake of clarity and was immediately met with pushback. Some commenters thought I was implying causation. Even after clarifying the purpose of my discovery-phase UX research, the post was removed and the misunderstanding was not fully cleared. I wanted to invite discussion on the nuances of UX research in the context of health and food science.\nBackground\n:\nMy research explores how people perceive and act on personalized health information. The inspiration came from my grandmother and myself noticing how certain foods affected our bodies, such as aches or sluggishness, and realizing that people often do not fully understand how the foods they eat interact with their health. The \u201cHow\u201d in the title was purely observational and did not imply causation.\nResearch purpose\n:\nUnderstand where people get health information\nLearn how people perceive and use health information\nLearn how they perceive the effects of foods on their body\nIdentify pain points and benefits of existing health apps\nCollect behaviors and habits around diet and health\nResearch approach:\nThe goal is not to prove that knowledge alone improves health. Instead, I am conducting purely observational, discovery-phase UX research, focused on understanding behaviors and perceptions. Insights from this survey will inform user personas and stories, which will be used to design and develop a product tailored to real user needs. The survey was intentionally designed to be open-ended and observational, to hear other people\u2019s perspectives rather than inserting my own. This is to help mitigate bias.\nWhy this matters\n:\nKnowledge alone is limited but habits, preferences, and other psychological factors do matter\nUX research helps us understand how people perceive, interpret, and act on information before building features\nDiscovery-phase approach\n:\nI am collecting data on:\nHealth app usage\nDietary awareness and choices\nLifestyle habits and health conditions\nPain points with current apps\nUser perceptions of how food affects them\nI would love feedback from this community: Are there nuances I am missing in how UX research intersects with health behavior? Could my approach be improved to better understand behavior?\nThanks for taking the time to read.",

I feel like it\u2019s difficult to answer your question without understanding how you\u2019re collecting data.

We attempted this as a lab for one of the big three kombucha brands and it turns out to be significantly off in all methodologies and we ended up having to bite the bullet and sent the product out for a testing panel.\nSo yea op, your intuitions are correct, using calculated database nutritionals for fermented products is a real challenge for accurate nutritionals."

I\u2019ve received mixed responses from peers and managers. The argument I have towards pursing an online masters and or a certificate program is the appeal between the flexibility of still getting experience and going to school at the same time. However, the argument I have towards pursuing a master\u2019s in person is because my bachelors degree is in a field completely unrelated to food science, therefore I feel the need to fill in the foundational knowledge I didn\u2019t get in my bachelor\u2019s.

In a confined shipping container, this creates a positive feedback loop: one ripening mango triggers the rest, leading to a massive loss of inventory.\nThe Solution: Potassium Permanganate (KMnO4) Scrubbers\nOne of the most effective and elegant solutions is using\nPotassium Permanganate\nas an ethylene scavenger. It\u2019s usually impregnated onto a high-surface-area carrier like activated alumina or zeolite.\nThe Chemistry:\nKMnO4 is a powerful oxidizing agent. When ethylene gas passes through the media, it undergoes an oxidation reaction:\n3CH2=CH2 + 2KMnO4 + 4H2O -> 3HOCH2CH2OH + 2MnO2 + 2KOH\nThis reaction converts the gaseous ethylene into solid manganese dioxide (MnO2) and ethylene glycol, effectively \"locking\" the gas out of the atmosphere.\nWhy this is still the \"Gold Standard\":\nVisual Indicator:\nThe media changes color from a vibrant\npurple\nto a dull\nbrown/black\nas it becomes exhausted, making it easy for logistics teams to check efficacy at a glance.\nNon-Contact:\nThe fruit never touches the chemical; it simply breathes \"cleaned\" air.\nCost-Effective:\nCompared to complex ozone generators or vacuum systems, these sachets or filters are incredibly cheap for large-scale shipping.\nA quick question for the pros here:\nI've noticed that for certain organic-certified shipments, there are strict regulations on the use of chemical scavengers. Have any of you worked with\nnatural alternatives\n(like clay-based minerals or specialized bio-polymers) that can match the KMnO4 efficiency?\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts on the future of shelf-life extension!",

Though, I had a lot of interesting talks with people more educated in flavour (especially regarding product quality) and from this experience I'd say: both.\nOn one hand the processing does result in a loss of flavour compounds. This may include \"wanted\" compounds, as you argued, but definetly also includes unwanted off flavours (especially low weight aldehydes and acids, mostly rancids or by products from fermentation).\nAnd this definetly affects the percived aroma profile. One for the strong reason of (retronasal) perception of volatile aromatics, and two for the reason of affected synergism/ agonism. Though, interestingly, bitterness is only very mildly affected by other tastes. Hence, I suspect(!) that the bitterness would be high whatsoever.\nMind aswell that the processing - especially the roasting - does introduce bittering agents (Maillard enters the chat)."

Or how many min do I need to expose it if so?\nI really want to avoid any chemical preservative as much I can.\nAny help appreciated!",
        "top_comment": "The cloudy stuff is likely yeast or mold, yes.\nOne hour of sunlight will not do anything of note to your product. Many hours still will not. UV sterilization in an industrial context is very different that normal sunlight (and your amber glass bottle exists to\nprevent\nmuch of that UV light from getting in). Basically, I'd just abandon any ideas around using sunlight as a kill step here.\nWhat's your pH? Potassium sorbate is not particularly effective at neutral or near-neutral pH. It does well in more acidic solutions. I also would not recommend just automatically jumping to the max legal usage rate. You typically start lower, do a shelf life study, and up it if you need to.\nIf this is a solution of just sucralose, stevia extract, and water, you really should not be keeping that for three weeks. There's essentially nothing preserving it, aside from possibly refrigeration. I'd expect a week\nmax\nof refrigerated shelf life.\nWhat's the final application here? If your sweetener solution is very concentrated and being used at a low level in finished product, you might be able to get away with just adding a good dose of acid.\nAny opposition to my favorite food preservation method, a freezer? If this is for beverages at home, you could make the solution, freeze cubes based on how much you put in a serving, and thaw as needed."

        "body": "I\u2019m currently an 18 year old senior right now doing 18 year old senior things which is contemplating college or no college\nMy first question is if \u201cfood scientist\u201d is a real job or if thats an umbrella term for a bunch of food science related careers? Ever since I learned about food science, I\u2019ve thought that I would love to have this as a career \u2026 after further investigation I saw that food scientist was acknowledged on the occupational outlook handbook from the bureau of labor statistics. From that point I saw that as my dream career but is there more than that? is there more roles deeper than just \u201cfood scientist\u201d ? If there is, can somebody tell me what type of role I should be shooting for if I want to at least make 75K a year post graduation?\nSecond question is do you need to have a food science degree in order to become a food scientist? I only ask this because i\u2019m in a scenario where as long as I stay in my state, my tuition is covered at any college I go to. However I still have to pay the rest of the other costs like dorms and food (which is at least another 10k that my family worries they cannot afford). But I live in a college town and my parents are proposing that I stay at home (therefore avoiding the fees) and go to the college near me. The only problem is that this college doesn\u2019t have food science as a degree, and theres only one college in my state that DOES have food science as a major but its long hours away and of course I would have to deal with the heavy additional costs if I attend there \u2014 and also as of recently this college gave me an admission letter saying that I can be accepted there. Now I\u2019d be willing to go to my hometown college as long as I can do another major and still get my dream job as a \u201cfood scientist\u201d.\nAnd third and last question as just a little filler, is it even possible to get into the food science industry without any degree? Won\u2019t clarify much on that one as I see that situation as being very unlikely for me",

Full timers constantly OT-ing due to last minute sample requests from sales people.\nSalary Gap: As compared to other specialties like business, science has one of the lowest pays. My friends with a fresh diploma only earns about $2.4k/month after CPF.\nSlow Career progression: Since the job market is very small for Food Science, the career progression is very slow. My manager who has a degree, had to work in this company for 15 years before progressing from a Senior Lab Technician to a Manager.\nFor more context, I somewhat have a small background on Business as I have a small business whereby I\u2019m running a one-man show, managing inventory, doing accounting and marketing all by myself, as well as events. Hence, I do have a starting point somewhere, it won\u2019t be a drastic jump for me.\nI\u2019m considering whether I should pursue a Food Science degree or pivot entirely to Business since the job market is broader.",

HOWEVER the bell pepper intolerance persists and it's really cumbersome for her because they're in most dishes. I wanted to help research a possible aid!\nFood science is really cool and I was wondering if there was maybe a specific enzyme she doesn't have enough of to break down a specific compound inside bell peppers? It didn't seem to be carotenoid related or profilin related given her symptoms. From what she's told me the result of eating bell peppers is that she gets terrible stomach aches and nausea.\nAnyways, my thoughts are jumbled and I was hoping to hear people's thoughts of the cause and hopefully come up with somethin'!

It is also commonly applied as a reference method for NIR calibration, due to its speed, automation, and good repeatability when properly validated.\nI understand that Kjeldahl is a classical and historically established method, but I would appreciate your input on:\nIn which specific contexts would Dumas not be considered acceptable for grain analysis?\nAre there any regulatory or normative restrictions, or is the resistance mainly related to tradition rather than analytical limitations?\nAny practical experience or technical references would be very helpful.

        "body": "For context: I've got a very cheap coffee machine. Like, maybe one level above the ones you'd find in a Motel6. It's got a hot plate to keep your coffee warm that a) gets a bit too hot imo and b) has absolutely no timer, thermometer, or failsafe of any kind for when you inevitably leave the thing on.\nSo I left about two cups of very normal brewed coffee in there overnight, and in the morning, of course all the water had boiled off. But my kitchen smelled Absolutely. Amazing.\nI knew instantly what had happened from the smell, so I quickly shut off the machine. Took a look inside the decanter: bunch of toasty coffee residue. Took a whiff: just a truly wonderful smell. Like burnt popcorn but in the best way possible (including the butteriness), vanilla, almonds, and somehow a little clove despite not having used a flavored coffee. Absolutely no unpleasant notes; if it were a candle on a shelf, I'd buy three.\nThere wasn't anything useful in there, but a little boiling water grabbed most of the stuff off the glass. Tasting notes: like if you smoked an already super smokey whiskey and then got rid of the whiskey. Not exactly delicious, but a little sugar dissolved in there made it pretty good, like the best parts of a s'more.\nObviously there was some caramilization that happened, but that's the extent of my knowledge. I never work with candy or hot sugars or anything like that; the one time I tried to make candied walnuts was a relatively good-tasting disaster.\nI want to recreate this smell/taste in a syrup or something, but ideally faster than a couple teaspoons/day, and without making a stainless saucepan look like I tried to DIY Teflon. Any advice would be appreciated.\nHappy Cooking!",

        "body": "Palm oil seems to be increasingly replacing dairy fats in many foods. I've stopped buying many products because they are no longer the delicious food they used to be. The latest was a tin of 'butter biscuits' that my family bought me for Christmas. As soon as I opened them, I could tell from the smell that came from the tin. The first bite tasted as it smelled, and my suspicions were confirmed by looking at the ingredients. Palm oil was listed as both the 2nd and 3rd ingredient, with butter relegated to 5th. The tin went straight into the bin.\nI've had similar experiences with chocolate and ice cream, some of them market-leading brands that have suddenly changed for the worse. The degradation in flavour and texture is often not subtle, to the point that you wonder how the reformulated product ever got through testing without being rejected.\nSo, here is my question. I remember reading about a gene that makes some people more sensitive to the flavour of different fats. Could it be that there is a large enough portion of the general population who simply can't taste the difference, so corporations are going to continue with substituting palm oil into everything because they know there are enough people who won't know the difference and will therefore keep buying their products?\nAlternatively, am I alone in this view, and just used to growing up with and enjoying the taste of dairy fats?",
        "top_comment": "I worked on some reformulations that went from butter to palm. It's all cost at the end of the day. Large food companies are almost all publicly traded, and they're in perpetual search of increased revenue and profits every quarter. When I worked for one, multiple times a year we'd get the order to reduce cost for products yet again. Sometimes they'd want, say, $5M of savings in the next two months or something equally unlikely to happen.\nYou can only do so much, especially when many ingredient prices are going up, labor costs are going up, and\nyou've already done five cost savings projects on that product in the last five years\n. Those incremental cuts can lead to fairly significant changes, including swaps to palm oil.\nYou may be detecting rancidity (those blocks of palm are often shipped on a\nslooooow\nbarge across the ocean, and the heat during that journey can accelerate the process). I can almost always tell when a product uses palm instead of butter, but it's mostly the\nabsence\nof butter flavor, plus a bit of textural difference. If someone is used to eating snacks/baked goods that use palm, they may not notice it as much, sort of like other items out there have off notes many people ignore (Hershey's chocolate, Chobani yogurt, nearly any macadamia nut not near its origin)."

        "top_comment": "This reminds me of black sesame paste in Japan, or the sweet tahini in the Balkans. Going off intuition, you might want to look into emulsifiers to prevent separation, which would cause the non oil components to set like cement. As far as refrigeration goes, you may be able to look up manufacturing procedures for similar products. I assume it's based on filling your product hot and sealing it off. There's not a lot of moisture in sesame paste, so it shouldn't be a massive problem."

I was hoping xanthan gum would do the trick but it was breaking under the reheat. Started digging around some and picked up a bottle of Polysorbate 80! I heated my 2-1 Franks/butter sauce up and I had the immersion blender in it while it was heating up and it was holding together pretty well. At about 140\u00b0, I added the Polysorbate at 0.3% and the sauce completely broke immediately and no amount of blending is bringing it back together. Not the desired outcome.\nAny advice for me here? Not sure what to try next. Cool it off some and keep blending? Throw it out and try again adding the Poly to the Franks cold, and then slowly incorporating the butter?\nMy ultimate goal is to initially make a big batch of the sauce, reheat a portion daily, then hold that portion hot and stable at about 140\u00b0 on the steam well so that it presents nice on my wings and I don't have to sub butter flavored oil for real butter\nAny wisdom is greatly appreciated!\n*******UPDATE********\nI let the initial failed batch cool for a couple of hours, then I reblended it and VOILA! It emulsified quickly. I heated it up and it stayed put. I also made another batch, this time, adding the Polysorbate 80 to the water portion while it was cool, then heated it up and added the butter, and it also worked well and is holding at 150\u00b0ish in my steam table.\nSo it worked as described but the Poly needs to be added to the water portion, and it needs to be at least not hot. Also it's working well with 0.1% xanthan gum so far.",
        "top_comment": "Not exactly a chemistry answer but holding a buffalo style hot sauce at 140f is going to seriously degrade it over the course of a couple hours. Frank's is a vinegar based hot sauce and keeping it at 140f is going to seriously change it's composition and flavor. Frank's and salted butter are both fairly safe at even room temp, so keeping it that hot seems overkill.\nWhen I was working wing joints we would just put the bottle in warm water at the start of service and shake it up prior to use... That's the cheap, simple and most effective method for restaurant level use case imo.\nYou could also just keep your wing bowls somewhere hot, and warm the hot sauce in them while the wings are cooking. If you don't want to risk keeping any sauce in the danger zone for 3 hours this is your best bet imo."

        "top_comment": "It's mostly the nitrites. Nitrites convert into nitrosamines when they're heated and this compound is a known carcinogen. Luncheon meat will get cooked during retorting and often again before serving. Salt contents also tend to be high in canned meat products to mask off flavours from intense cooking. There is some concern about emulsifiers and gums like carrageenan or phosphates that some data shows to negatively impact the gut lining.\nThe other side of this is what these products displace in the diet. Eating processed meat comes at the expense of potentially eating something more nutritious. Sterilizing foods destroys lots of vitamins so you may get better nutrition from products that are less intensely processed."

I have worked with a couple who will send out products to be tested at a 3rd party lab, and pay for the claimed nutrient information on label to be tested for. This has been on a rotational basis, as the FDA states values must be within 20% variance, so they are looking for a \"close enough\" number.\nAt the end of the day, no one is policing the shelves and holding brands accountable, except for the occasional consumer advocacy group who may test for certain promoted nutrients.\nSupplements are different, and added nutrients should have some kind of rotating testing regime.

This only exacerbates the problem bc I feel like there\u2019s going to be BA developed on the dishes and then I feel like I can\u2019t get it off anything in my life.\nI was making something with cornstarch last Friday and the bowl went unwashed. The cornstarch was used to coat recently boiled and still wet tofu and then fried. Not really a problem if cleaned up properly but\u2026.after a few days I had a thought that it might be producing BA because it\u2019s a corn product and haven\u2019t been able to deal with that since.\nSo my question is:\nCooking can kill the bacteria that produces BA, but BA itself is heat stable once created.\nDoes the process of commercial corn starch manufacturing involve any steps at which the bacteria would be killed? Like do I even need to be worried about it in this instance?\n(More a question for\nr/food\nsafety, but:) And is there any good way to get rid of BA once it\u2019s created? Would a strong basic solution like bleach work to at least damage the BA so it\u2019s not so dangerous? Ie to clean off surfaces that can\u2019t be easily washed",

        "body": "I'd like to understand more about what's happening when I cream coffee and sugar (a la Cuban coffee), so I'm designing a small experiment to do in my kitchen. Pretty simple: creaming different types of sugar with different substrates (i.e. fats, such as butter) as well as solvents (coffee). (Probably getting some vocab here, meh. My science background is all social science and philosophy.)\nI'm looking for recommendations as to journals I should look at to find more information about:\nCreaming sugar with different materials\nHow the solubility of sugar affects its ability to be creamed with different materials\nThe amount of air added to a mixture by creaming\nHow culinary foams are developed\nHow the particle density (ppm I guess?) of a liquid creaming pair for sugar impacts the limit of aeration\n(If anyone happens to have links to articles on these subjects, that would be wonderful, but I'm not expecting that.)\nPrior to making Cuban coffee, creaming has been a colder-temperature process in my mind. A la Kenji's article on creaming\nsugar and butter\n, I've been chilling both my butter and sugar before creaming for ages. Cuban coffee flies in the face of that knowledge: adding ~1.5tsp of steaming hot coffee to sugar and creaming the sugar with it. After the sugar and coffee are creamed, adding the rest of your coffee creates a surprisingly dense (and\ndurable\nfoam). I'm really curious to know more about this process, but I can't find a lot of information about it online. It's something I'd like to understand more about, since I think I could make some really cool pastry toppings understanding this process better.\nIf you've never heard of Cuban coffee, here's a short video:\nMokaBee\nThe Experiment\nThe question I'm trying to work out is what is allowing for the coffee and sugar to cream. Like I said, I've been under the impression that you're really relying on the fat from butter to create the structure for sugar to cut into to create pockets of aeration. Here, I'm not sure what's providing that lattice. Is it really just the natural oil in coffee that enables the sugar to cream? That seems impressive to me, given that the fat content of coffee can't be\nthat\nhigh (at least, as far as I imagine). But I can't work out what else it is.\nAnyways, the other interesting bit of all of this is that I don't use white granulated sugar. I toast all of the sugar I use until it's got about the color of dark brown sugar. I'm planning out an experiment where I'll cream 20, 30, 40, and 50g of:\ngranulated white sugar\ncane sugar\ntoasted sugar\neach with five, ten, and fifteen grams of moka pot-brewed coffee. Unfortunately, it's hard to use electric mixers on such a small amount of coffee and sugar, so I'll likely be doing this by hand, but I'm going to try doing it with an electric hand mixer in a small mason jar first and seeing if I can get a good cream from that. (Or I might skip the weight differences in the sugar and stick to 40g sugar with ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty five grams of coffee... there's some thinking to do here still.) I'll also be simply pouring the coffee directly onto the sugar and stirring to combine as a control.\nWhat am I trying to work out..? I'm not sure, exactly. But I miss doing science and I miss experiment design, so in the absolute worst case, I have a fun time making a mess of my kitchen. Best case, I learn something no one's ever put down on paper before!\nAnyways. if nothing else, I hope someone enjoys reading this post. It'd make my month if someone could recommend me some reading, and I'd also love feedback on my experiment design if there's anything glaring someone sees wrong about my approach so far.",

I don't care much about that at the moment. I just can't fucking figure out how sugar and coffee are creaming together and I want to understand what's happening to allow for that. I guess maybe the proteins and lipids of the coffee are combining to create enough texture for the coffee to successfully cream? Mysteries, mysteries."

For some flavors, like a toasted coconut or a baked apple, you might toast or brown the fruit first. You can use spices, different sugars like palm, or extracts to make the flavors more interesting.\nGoogle kiwi simple syrup and oleo saccharum for ideas. It\u2019s not hard to get strong and delicious flavors from fruit.

The science is established and has been exploited for years.\nAs a non-drinker I am always on the lookout for the new and novel, but sweet bubbly fruit is rarely more than sweet bubbly fruit. I want something.. else? More? I just try things, often adding things to my \"that was unfortunate\" list.\nLately I have been working with my modified AI engine to help me identify things that go together in uncommon ways. I basically start with my goal, then reverse engineer it. This is the result of one of those attempts.\n(As an aside, I asked it to come up with a gold dress/blue dress drink guaranteed to get people arguing about what it tastes like and the result was very, very strange.)\nAt the very least, this recipe led to a refined recipe for a Szechuan pepper simple syrup. This is pretty uncommon. I knew it existed, but have never seen it on the wild. This adjusts the published versions and turns them into a descriptive chem lab process. If nothing else, this gives a powerful kick to espresso, hot chocolate or even vanilla ice cream. Don't use too much, the pepper contains something called hydroxy-alpha-sanshool, which activates nerves that tingle or buzz. For the true science people you are blocking potassium channels which depolarizes small and large diameter neurons which signals the brain \"huh?\"\nThe recipe bit is mostly AI formatting.\n\u200b1. The Ingredients\u200b\n2 tbsp Szechuan Peppercorns: Freshness matters\u2014if they don't numb your tongue when you chew one raw, throw them away.\u200b\n1 cup Water\u200b\n1 cup White Sugar: Use plain white sugar; the neutral profile lets the peppercorn's citrus notes shine.\n\u200bOptional: A pinch of salt (to sharpen the sensation).\u200b\nThe Process\u200b\nThe Toast (Activation): Place the whole peppercorns in a dry pan over medium heat. Shake them constantly for about 60\u201390 seconds. Stop the second you smell a floral, citrusy aroma. Do not let them smoke\u2014burnt Szechuan pepper tastes like ash.\u200b\nThe Crack: Transfer the warm peppercorns to a mortar and pestle (or use the bottom of a heavy skillet). Give them a rough crush. You don\u2019t want powder; you want the husks broken open to expose the oils.\u200b\nThe Infusion: Combine the water and sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer until the sugar dissolves. Add the crushed peppercorns and turn the heat to the lowest possible setting.\n\u200b\nThe Steep: Let it sit on low heat for 10 minutes, then remove from heat entirely. Let it steep as it cools (about 20\u201330 minutes).\u200b\nThe Strain: Fine-strain through a mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a glass jar.\n\u200bPro-Tip: If the syrup isn't vibing enough for you, add a 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid. The acidity acts as a catalyst for the tingling sensation on the tongue.\n\u200bStorage & Utility\n\u200bLifespan: Keeps in the fridge for about 2 weeks.\nThen for the drink itself. I wanted sonething with a heavy mouth-feel, but not beat you over the head. Something dry (which is why I swear by the Tabasco hack which has never failed to impress), and something designed not to be chugged.\nThe black tea contains L-theanine, which is chemically similar to gaba, and the peper also contains pipeline, which prevents metabolism of the L-theanine. There is a bunch of chemistry I know as a drinker but not asva biochemistry, but the effects are all there if you really want to dig deep.\nBack to AI presenting. You'll see some weird wording in there, that's an artifact of me using examples of things to train it how to examine things.\nThe Components\n\u200b4 oz Strong Lapsang Souchong Tea (Cold): This provides the \"smoke\" and a heavy dose of tannins to dry out the tongue.\n\u200b1 oz Fresh Grapefruit Juice: For acidity and a specific pithy bitterness that interacts with the smoke. The fresher the better.\u200b\n0.5 oz Szechuan Peppercorn Syrup: This is the \"crack\" in the recipe. (gives a tingling sensation), which mimics the nerve-burn of high-proof spirits.\u200b\n2 dashes Celery Bitters: (Alcohol-free version) Adds an herbal, savory \"thread\" to keep it from becoming a juice box.\u200b\nGarnish: A single, expressed sprig of burnt Rosemary.\n\u200bThe Build\n\u200bSyrup Prep: Simmer 1 part water, 1 part sugar, and 1 tbsp toasted Szechuan peppercorns. Strain and cool.\u200b\nThe Shake: Combine all liquid ingredients in a shaker with exactly three large ice cubes. You aren't looking for massive dilution; you want a sharp chill that preserves the tea's viscosity.\u200b\nThe Pour: Fine strain into a chilled Coupe glass.\n\u200bThe Finisher: Torch the rosemary sprig until it smokes, then drop it in.",

I mean, there are so many options - how do I decide which one to choose - the criterias to look for when selecting  one for consultation?\n2) What are the exact processes of developing a food idea to a first prototype?  - I have already done  kitchen sink formula, but its not enough - I will need help with shelf life stability, packaging and efficiency of my product design etc\n3) Oh man !

I was interested in R&D as it seemed to be the closest I could get to working in a lab but now after doing more research I am not sure if that is the case. I know I still have time to switch my classes but I was hoping to have been decided on a major so I could start grinding out the work and get into a good job but I am worried I am picking a career that will leave me unhappy in life. I really like the idea of working in a lab but I know depending on the career lab work changes.\nSo basically what can you do with a BS in Food Science that could get you into a lab?

Most of what people talk about will be in quality assurance or R&D. There are a lot more quality assurance jobs than there are R&D jobs in general. There is a significant need for food scientists at virtually all food production facilities, and they are pretty much everywhere. There are fewer centers for research. There are also jobs around food safety, food engineering, food law, technical sales, project management, all kinds of things. Some companies require graduate degrees, typically masters, for their R&D positions, but that is not always the case.\nI did not get a nutrition degree, but MY understanding is that it is easier to find a job in food science as a food science major than it is to get a nutrition job with a nutrition degree.

I thought of serving 2 different beans at a time in the same single use bowls at the same temp (undecided yet). Would microwaving be ok or would it be better to heat them on the hob? None of the participants will know what brand they are tasting as all will be labelled alphabetically.\nEach time I'll ask participants to rate the beans 1-5 (or is 1-10 better?). The beans that will score lower in its match will be eliminated thus the second round will have 8 beans, then 4 where we will decide the winner\nI'll have English breakfast tea and buttered bread as palette cleanser.\nAny ideas if the tasting could be improved?",

I have a few specific questions for those currently in Ireland:\nJob Market: How is the demand for Food Quality Analysts or Regulatory Affairs specialists for international students? Is it realistic to expect a job that sponsors a Critical Skills Employment Permit?\nFinancial Independence: Given the current housing crisis and high cost of living in cities like Dublin or Cork, is the starting salary (approx. \u20ac35k-\u20ac40k) enough to live independently and pay off a student loan?\nCareer Path: In India, I could aim for FSSAI (Govt) or private MNCs. In Ireland, what are the chances of a non-EU citizen getting into regulatory or administrative roles versus just lab-based QC roles?\nROI: For someone whose main goal is \"earning good money\" in the long run, does Ireland offer a better 5-year trajectory than staying in India and climbing the corporate ladder in the food industry?\nWould love some \"real talk\" on the ground reality of the food industry in Ireland for 2026.

Chili activates TRPV1 heat/pain receptors, while mustard and wasabi trigger TRPA1, which produces sharp pungency without lingering burn.

I\u2019m working in the labelling and packaging dept. and I\u2019m developing skills in Navision and SAP.\nI never thought I would have had this as my first job but I\u2019m liking it and I\u2019m understanding that probably, academic life is not made for me and that industry could be my thing.\nOnly issue I\u2019m experimenting right now is that I\u2019ve been working a full time job (40h a week) while studying a REAL master, with 8 exams and a dissertation (if I can do everything on time it should end on October \u201826)\nI am particularly liking BASH programming and I want to study R and Python programming, as I believe they could; somehow, be useful in the future (even if I still don\u2019t know how).\nBut on the other side I\u2019m starting to think that it makes no point into studying proteomics and stuff (6 exams!) and a \u201comics\u201d dissertation.\nI don\u2019t want to destroy myself while working 40h a week to just have another certification that adds nothing to my CV and isn\u2019t useful to boost it up.\nI\u2019m starting to think I could follow the R and Python lessons, give up the master and start programming on my own while I am at home, to develop the most expertise I can and later find a way to invest it in my CV.\nWhat do you think?\nI am not talking about giving up just because I\u2019m spoiled and I don\u2019t want to work hard; it\u2019s just that I reached a point t where I am fed up with adding theory to my expertise and seeing that nobody considers me as an asset because I have no experience. If I have to study until Oct\u201926 I can do it but I want to be sure it\u2019s worth the effort\n(In case you wanna see the master\u2019s programme it\u2019s called\nMaster en bioinform\u00e1tica - VIU; there\u2019s the English version too)",

Does cost more money, though, and it takes a hair longer for the sour taste to hit. Some may work better than others depending on the moisture content of your bar."

I cooked the mixture on low flame for about 20\u201322 minutes, but I didn\u2019t use a thermometer, so I don\u2019t know the exact temperature.\nI did do three formulation trials, all cooked under the same low-flame, time-controlled conditions:\nTest 1: 70:30 sapota:dates (1/3 cup pulp, 1/4 cup sugar)\nTest 2: 50:50 sapota:dates (1/4 cup pulp total, 1.5 tbsp sugar)\nTest 3: 30:70 sapota:dates (1/4 cup pulp total, 1 tbsp sugar)\nNow I\u2019m confused about a few things and would really appreciate advice:\nHow serious is it that I didn\u2019t record the cooking temperature?\nFor a UG-level project, can this be treated as a limitation if time and flame were controlled?\nWhat tests make sense for the final toffee product?\nApart from sensory evaluation, I feel there aren\u2019t many options. Is a short-term shelf-life study (visual changes, texture, fungal growth) enough?\nCan I include tests like TSS (\u00b0Brix)?\nI didn\u2019t actually measure TSS using a refractometer.

        "body": "I\u2019m currently working as a QA/QC manager in an industrial agriculture setting, responsible for FSMA/HACCP compliance around our byproduct that gets blended into animal feed rations.\nI\u2019ve got an industrial engineering degree, and my current role (plus educational background pre major change) have given me decent exposure to chemical engineering. If I were looking to make a jump to a food science related role, what types of roles might someone with my experience look for? Do many companies count on training process-specific knowledge on the job or with company-sponsored trainings (e.g. developing knowledge on labeling, non-bulk packaging, color additive requirements that aren\u2019t applicable in my industry, specialized info about canning, dairy, organic, others with specific additional regs ) or are you expected to develop that knowledge on your own before/after hire?\nI\u2019d also like to ask what part of the industry you work in, and how does it pay? I\u2019m currently making ~$100k in a LCOL area, so many times when looking at other industries, the change doesn\u2019t make sense because it would require a huge pay cut for the same/higher responsibility.",
        "top_comment": "Hi!! I\u2019m a new grad so there\u2019s some questions I can\u2019t answer, but you definitely can make a switch into a Food science role! The great thing about food science is that it\u2019s versatile so the experience you have is pretty dang great! You can still do work in QA/QC as a lot of the things you did in your current job will overlap in the food industry. You could also work as a food engineer. I\u2019d do a little research on what food engineers do overall for some context.\nBased on what I\u2019ve noticed when job searching, since processes vary from company to company, I noticed that they prefer that you are able to be trained on their specific processes. I don\u2019t particularly know what they do for people who\u2019ve been on the work field for a while, but I\u2019m sure others could chime in on that. Although, for the examples you gave, I do think it\u2019s important to have basic understanding and knowledge over things like diary, organics, understanding how a certain process can affect the quality of the product. Knowing the biological makeup of milk for example as that would affect how it would be processed."

Over time the weak gel restructures and eventually starts to cream, after a certain delay time during which the sample looks stable. The delay time is increased by: more concentrated emulsion, higher thickener concentration and higher thickener efficiency.

Why is that? Is there another contributing factor other than the Maillard reaction?\nIs it simply just the xanthophyll inside the yolk browning?

        "top_comment": "Plant proteins are good thickening and gelating agents... whey proteins require much higher concentrations.\nThe reason basically is, that whey proteins are already well soluable and fairly small. So they do not tend to give strong interactions.\nPlant proteins tend to be far bigger. So they tend to bumb into eachother more easily, and therefore increase viscosity. Also, they tend to be less soluable. So, even though commercial protein for drinks has increased soluability, their tendency to interact with eachother remains higher, hence aggregate more easily and increase viscosity as explained (or even form gels).\nFurther, whey proteins are mostly hydrophilic. So they really tend more to stay hydrated. When making pudding, the pudding powder forms a gel enclosing the water. The hydrated whey protein hinders this structure.\nPlant proteins have big hydrophobic regions. By adding the pudding powder you immobilize the water. The smaller amount of water available makes it even more favourable for the proteins to interact via their hydrophobic regions, forming strong structurs. Basically supporting gel like Events. The whey proteins miss such strongly pronounced hydrophobic regions."

We\u2019ve tried playing with:\n    \u2022 Different plant-based fats\n    \u2022 Different sugar combinations (including trehalose)\n    \u2022 Small amounts of gums\n    \u2022 Adding air without the texture collapsing later\nWhere we\u2019re getting stuck is:\n    \u2022 Getting it airy without it collapsing or getting icy over time\n    \u2022 Keeping it creamy without it turning gummy or chewy\n    \u2022 Making sure the texture still feels good after long frozen storage\nI\u2019m not looking for formulas, just general direction or things I should be thinking about:\n    \u2022 Is this kind of texture realistically achievable in a vegan frozen product?\n    \u2022 Are there ingredient types or approaches that are commonly used for this?\n    \u2022 Any big pitfalls I might be missing?\nThanks so much. Any insight is appreciated.",
        "top_comment": "If you aren\u2019t using dextrose you should try that. It\u2019s creamier and generally more stable/ less icy than sucrose.  I usually use a combination of guar and locust bean gums and sunflower lecithin.   Starches will likely help too.\nWhat is your process for making the ice cream?  If you aren\u2019t pre-chilling your base that will make a big texture difference too.\nIcecreamcalc.com is a helpful resource."

I was asked about my\nprevious experience\n, how I\napproach new learning\n, and how I\ncollaborate with cross-functional teams\n. There was also a question about\nU.S. work authorization\n, and based on how the conversation continued, it seems\nOPT candidates are being considered\nfor this role.\nI\u2019ve now been\nscheduled for a more in-depth interview with the engineering team\n. I\u2019m expecting this next round to include\nprocess/technical questions relevant to a Process Engineer I role\n, along with some\nbehavioral questions\n.\nIf anyone has gone through the Chobani (Twin Falls) process engineer interviews, I\u2019d appreciate any insights on:\nThe\ntechnical depth\nthey expect at this stage ?\nCommon\nprocess or troubleshooting questions ?\nHow best to prepare coming from a\nnon-dairy manufacturing background ?\nUpdate 2: Panel Interview + Plant Tour Invite\nQuick update \u2014 I had the\npanel interview yesterday\n. There were\n3 interviewers\n: a\nDirector, a Manager, and a Process Engineer\n. The panel was very welcoming, but the interview itself was\npretty intense\n.\nQuestions covered:\nWalkthrough of my\npast experience\nHow I\ntroubleshoot systems with minimal guidance\nMy\nweaknesses\nI mentioned\ncontrolled variables\n\u2014 how I used and managed them\nI mentioned\ndata usage\n\u2014 how I collected, analyzed, and managed data\nFamiliarity with the\nTwin Falls, Idaho location\nUnderstanding of\npositive displacement pumps\nMy proficiency with\nPower BI and MATLAB\nOverall, it felt very\nhands-on and problem-solving focused\n.\nToday, I received an email inviting me for a\nplant tour and a final interview\n.\nFor those who\u2019ve been through this stage at Chobani (or similar food manufacturing roles):\nWhat should I expect during the\nplant tour + final interview\n?\nWhat are they typically\nevaluating at this stage\n(technical depth, ownership mindset, culture fit)?\nAny tips on how to prepare or things I should definitely brush up on?\nAppreciate any insights \u2014 thanks again to everyone who helped earlier \ud83d\ude4f",

        "top_comment": "r/breadit\nmay be able to help.\nYes, storing dough in the fridge is a standard practice to develop flavor and slow rise. It depends on the formula if you're able to bake straight from the fridge- some people swear by it but I've never had good luck. Reducing the amount of yeast to slow the rise will also help extend the fermentation time. This is also going to extend your bulk fermentation time though so you'll have to plan accordingly."

        "top_comment": "Can you tell us what kinds of flavors you're going for? Fat carries flavor, so it makes sense that a fat free or very low fat food would not be as flavorful. When the first wave of anti fat sentiment rolled out in the FDA, many companies cut fat, but boosted sugar to make up for the flavor loss. Personally, I steer clear of any \"fat free\" products at the grocery store, so you can get less biased opinions from someone else. My advice would be to add flavor in the form of \"chocolate\" chips. It doesn't have to be chocolate, but the point is that it will carry the fat without getting homogenized in the protein bar. Heterogeneity should help make the flavor more noticeable."

They can often have a lot of sugar, salt, fat and more which can be fine to consume some of, but if it is your only food source can easily be a less than ideal diet (huge category and easy to generalize).\nStorage conditions, packaging, and ingredients absolutely can change flavor in addition to time. End of shelf life products will generally have a less pungent flavor (until spoilage) when compared to a fresh control. Changing ingredients will also change flavor.\nI guess I'm a little lost on the actual point of this post.

        "body": "Please delete if this is not allowed. I am just genuinely curious and would like more information.\nToday I quit my job because I threw away about 6 small cases of strawberries after noticing that in each case there was at least 1-3 strawberries in each one that had visible mold spores. From what I know, if there\u2019s mold on something like that it should be thrown away. But I got chewed out by my manager because he says I should\u2019ve asked him first before I threw them away, and it\u2019s because he wanted me to pick around the bad strawberries and keep \u201cthe good ones\u201d. He tried using chat gpt and other AI\u2019s to prove to me that if there\u2019s mold on food you can pick around it, and that since he\u2019s been through multiple hours of manager training for his food safety certifications and what not he knows more about this subject than I do. Based off of the small research I have done, according to the USDA if there\u2019s mold on soft produce it should be discarded. From what I rememeber learning in culinary classes in high school, as well as when taking my food safety courses to work in this restaurant, if there\u2019s mold on something that you visibly see that means it\u2019s already spread through out everything else, and if you are serving food through a commercial kitchen where you feed the general public then you should treat these things with extra caution. Because you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re customer is elderly, a child, or immune comprised which all puts those categories at high risk for infection/sickness.\nLook im not very smart, but I want to learn to know if i was right or wrong truly. Id also like to ask other managers what you were taught or what you do in these situations and what your training taught you to do when mold is present. I\u2019d also like to mention my manager was going to reuse those strawberries after he picked them out of the trash can I threw them in.\nEdit : since people think I\u2019m being argumentative by giving more context in responses , I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really just trying to give more context. There are a lot of other factors that I think go into play about how this restaurant works that I feel would help explain even more the reasoning behind throwing away these small cases of strawberries . And for those wanting the link about the usda I will leave it below. I wanted to learn how mold works with produce/ strawberries and what to do in the case of a commercial kitchen that sells food to an elderly community base because I thought if what I learned about mold was true, then it should be thrown out. I also wanted to know a managers perspective because my manager was telling me he didn\u2019t learn about mold . Also I\u2019m not sure if by cases people are assuming I\u2019m throwing away large amounts of strawberries. It was just little cases like the ones you get at Walmart that last about a week. This restaurant does not follow many guidelines that are set up for food safety, so I\u2019m sorry for trying to do the least I thought I could do and not serve strawberries that had mold on them, or were touching other ones that had mold on them. As some else said \u201cwhen in doubt throw it out\u201d, so that\u2019s what I did. I really did try to save strawberries , but each time I picked one up there was another moldy one right beneath it. I\u2019m seriously one of the few people in that kitchen who took extra steps to ensure there was zero product waste on the things I was working on. I feel like a jerk getting defensive like this but the way people communicate on here is so mean. I will not be coming back to this post but if you\u2019d like PM me to have a nice conversation where you can KINDLY explain to me how mold works and how it should be handled in a kitchen I\u2019d love that.\nUSDA FOOD SAFETY INFO: check page 5 for my reference.",
        "top_comment": "According\nto the USDA\n:\nWhen you find a few moldy pieces of fruit inside a container, throw out the moldy fruit and any pieces of fruit that are directly touching them. Take a close look at the remaining pieces of fruit: if there are no signs of mold and the fruit is not overly mushy, thoroughly wash the fruit prior to consuming."

Usually the approach for these team exercises is to give you some task (design something, solve a problem, come up with a solution to a long term issue) but they're less worried about you succeeding in the task itself as much as to see how you collaborate with others. They're watching out for a few things like are you leading but not dominating, are you pushing your own ideas or dropping them when someone else's idea is better, do you know how to talk to people and work under pressure. In the past I've seen those who are natural leaders, help bring together and organize their groups in a collaborative way (assign people to specific jobs, brainstorm together), typically are the ones who received offers. They also want to check your professionalism to determine if you are mature enough to take things seriously. Also sometimes I've seen them change something or give more information to the teams half way through to see how people react to pressure (stay professional, ability to pivot, can work with others amicably under pressure)."

I don't know how quince paste is made at larger scales but it's a simple product: fruit and sugar. cook, puree, reduce.\nI've been tinkering with vacuum evaporation. my intention is to remove enough water for the paste to set up well but retain more fresh flavors by keeping the temperature lower. I do my best to pick the fruit at optimum ripeness, so it seems like a bit of a shame to then cook all that peak flavor to death. I do wonder if lower temps might also prevent pectin from breaking down, but there's enough pectin in quince that the value there is probably marginal at best.\nat any rate, while there's plenty of room to improve my goofy little vacuum setup, it does remove water well enough for a proof of concept and I'll keep playing around with it. but about that water: when I empty the vacuum trap, the condensed water has a pretty intense quince smell and mild but nice quince flavor. so now I'm wondering if I'm just evaporating those same lovely flavors I'm going to some length to avoid degrading.\nso, before I dig out my old environmental and aquatic chemistry textbooks for a refresher on partial pressures of complex mixtures, Clausius-Clapeyron, &c, and then see what I can find about just what it is that makes a ripe quince smell so nice and what its mass transfer coefficient is, do you, the reader of\nr/foodscience\n, have experience/knowledge/thoughts/hunches with or about this stuff? is there a viable path for me to minimize the loss of volatile quince flavor/aroma compounds while evaporating water relatively quickly? can I control temp and pressure to keep it in the quince? distill the condensate afterward to get the good stuff back into the quince after it evaporates? rig a fractional column to condense water and flavor separately? some other thing I'm too ignorant to think of?\nagain, we're talking about hundreds of pounds in a season (maybe a small chance that gets as high as a thousand pounds eventually). as evidenced by the hoses and gauges my cookware seems to have sprouted recently, I'm willing to take this project beyond what a more reasonable person would, but I have limits. that said, if the typical methods to accomplish what I'm after are beyond my means, I'm still interested to learn about them.\nfor some context: not a food scientist, as I'm sure is already clear. I'm a few years out of civil and environmental engineering school (OK, maybe more than a few years). my real job has primarily been concerned with volumes of water, not constituents and concentrations. so while I've been exposed to and was at one time conversant in at least some of the chemistry involved (or at least the kinetics), it's been a while and this was never really squarely in my wheelhouse.\napologies for writing such a tome. after all that, have any help for me?",
        "top_comment": "You are definitely losing volatile flavour and aroma components.\nIt's a common thing with industrial concentration of many types of fruit juices and purees, so the evaporator systems used for processing on a large scale will often include specific aroma recovery stages for the evap water. The aroma is blended back into the concentrate after concentration, or sold as a separate product for use in manufacturing flavourings etc. It's not perfect in that you will always lose some flavour/aroma compared to the fresh juice, but it can make an absolutely massive difference for some fruits.\nIf you want to spend quite a lot of money there are various manufactures out there who can supply complete units to capture and separate the aromatic parts from the water, but it might be a bit OTT on the scale you're working on currently.\nI suspect the most practical option would be to look at a small distillation setup to run your evaporation water through. It won't be 100% perfect, but it should certainly be an improvement over where you are currently."

        "body": "I\u2019m looking for some perspective from people who\u2019ve worked in food R&D, especially sauces/condiments.\nI\u2019m currently a Food Technologist working in sauces and dressings. This is my first role focused on sauces \u2014 prior to this, I worked in nutritional supplements and formulated products, so I\u2019m comfortable with formulation, calculations, documentation, and regulated environments, but sauces are a new category for me.\nThe challenge I\u2019m running into isn\u2019t the technical work itself, but the management style of my direct supervisor.\nHe encourages me to \u201cask questions\u201d and \u201cbring ideas,\u201d but when I do, the interaction often turns into a Socratic quiz rather than collaboration. For example:\nI\u2019ll ask for input on color direction, ingredient selection, or processing approach\nInstead of guidance, I\u2019m asked a chain of questions (\u201cWhat does the ingredient statement say?\u201d \u201cWhat color is that?\u201d \u201cWhat makes things darker?\u201d)\nThe answer is eventually something straightforward (e.g., add ketchup, adjust the amount of oil or fat you put into it), but the process feels evaluative rather than instructional\nI\u2019m also getting feedback like:\n\u201cThis match is good, but it shouldn\u2019t have taken you 6 iterations \u2014 it should take 2\u20133\u201d\n\u201cI expect more from you,\u201d without clear criteria for what \u201cmore\u201d means\nWhen I ask how to get back on track, I\u2019m told to \u201ccheck the job description\u201d\nThere hasn\u2019t been much structured onboarding or explanation of how he expects decisions to be made, which makes it hard to know where initiative ends and over-stepping begins.\nI\u2019m trying to be self-reflective here:\nI am new to sauces\nI am still learning how brined peppers, vinegar strength, salt, TA, color, etc. interact at scale\nI\u2019m not afraid of doing homework or looking things up \u2014 I just expected more collaboration early on.\nWhat\u2019s throwing me off is that even when outcomes are acceptable, the process is criticized after the fact, which has made me hesitant to ask questions at all.\nSo my questions:\nIs this a normal \u201csink or swim\u201d management style in sauce R&D?\nHow do you handle a boss who teaches via quizzing instead of explaining?\nIs this something I should adapt to, or is it a red flag?\nAny advice on reframing questions so they don\u2019t trigger evaluation mode?\nI\u2019m not trying to bash anyone \u2014 I\u2019m genuinely trying to learn how to navigate this better without burning out or doubting myself.\nThanks in advance for any insight.",

That was till I found a recipe inside a textbook from Reddit that combined xanthan gum and gelatin. Tbh nothing more than that other than flavoring n technique. I thought it was cool and I needed new ways to use the xanthan gum so I gave it a try\nHowever I\u2019ve tried twice now (granted with way too many changes to have any sort of consistency here) but both times I\u2019ve gotten an off result. The first time I used a blueberry reduction. (That one I really messed up. Forgot to add the water and instead added powdered gelatin straight to boiling liquids. It was a mess) But I did get closer than I thought i would\u2019ve, to my desired outcome. I had a very loose gel like foam sitting on top of a super watery bottom layer. (TBH once ik it was shot I just started messing around to see what would happen and how things interacted.)\nThe second attempt I decided to cheat a little and used boxed jello (I imagine it\u2019s different but I would hope the concept would be close enough. Xantham gum would be used first to thicken the mix but also hold a lot of air and create a froth/foam that the gelatin would set and stabilize to touch). I decided to use a blender to mix the two and introduce the air. (To be clear jello + 1 cup cold water into blender, add 1 cup hot water, turn blender on and add xanthan gum) I did create a foam that I was looking for but the blender also seemed to \u201cbreak\u201d the mix as well. As I saw small separation between clumps and the liquid. So I poured it off into the fridge to set. Now after it\u2019s set I have my jello foam on top which is cool but the bottom half looks to be almost like regular , albeit looser and thinner, jello. Is there any way I can increase my foam yield and reduce this watery excess that seems to be separating out?\nMy first thought would be to change my technique. Like when to add each component and using gentler setting on the blender. After that I might move on to adjusting my ratios. Any and all insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you\nUpdate: the bottom part is not only super thin but very sweet. Like most of the flavor was either too heavy or fell out of the foam. Tbh the og recipe did call for soy sauce as the flavoring.",
        "top_comment": "Try \"blooming\" your gelatin in some hot water before you mix it with anything. These sounds like gelatin issue, unrelated to the xantham gum. I use xantham all the time, a blender would normally do the trick to incorporate just fine."

This recipe has a lot of fat, but this is not enough of a lubricant. And I don't want to add more fat. I can reduce the amount of nuts, but that's not my way of solving problems. I don't rule it out but that's the last resort because I have a hunch I won't like it more with better texture but less flavour.\nI already asked on\nr/icecreamery\nand the only answer I got was to try to improve emulsion in case that 2g lecithin is insufficient.

My school has very limited options so unfortunately I can't take other subjects that are related to food sciences. Btw I'm taking IGCSE\nI originally wanted to become a oncologist but I heard the medical pathway isn't worth it in my country. Since I've been into baking recently and have always been interested in science, especially when it's related to food like nutrition, I've thought of changing my pathway to food science. Will it be worth it?\nMy plan is to study a level in my country first, then maybe a bachelor overseas (thinking of a country that's quite in need of food science) so I can have experience there and possibly a higher chance of securing a job there. If not, bachelor in my own country then only find a job oversea. Working in my own country is the last thing I'll do since it is compulsory to sit for a certain national test and I'm refusing to do it (pls don't question me lol).

Just have a well rounded skill set, as you'll be learning chemistry, biochemistry, anatomy, even some physics for things like mixing, ha.\nIs food science worth it? It was for me. I loved my time in university once I switched to it. I'll tell you right now though: everyone wants to get into the fun R&D jobs. Those aren't always easy to get. In my experience, you either need to know someone or have at least a masters degree. And you might have to pay your dues with a low paying lab job with just a bachelors degree for a few years. But once you've found your niche in the industry, you can move up. I ended up specializing in QA paperwork, auditing, dealing with suppliers, that sort of thing.

        "top_comment": "I don\u2019t see anything that suggests the Nielson product is ultrafiltered. The black package is ultrafiltered milk. They physically remove minerals and lactose from that product whereas the Nielson they just add lactase and break the lactose down, but the sugar component remains. That\u2019s why you see the differences you see. Nothing to do with variation or herd. It\u2019s the process they are using."

Its hard to recommend a specific software without knowing more about your business.\nUltimately the best software or tracking system is the one where the majority of the work is done up front to build the system to be specific to your process.\nMy experience- the best systems can do the following:\nmaintain raw ingredients lot codes or POs thru out the process into work in process (WIP) and final id. A recall report for a single finished product pallet can give me all lots associated with this container for both WIP and raw coding.\ncan easily track WIP to Finish product loting via date time and pallet/container ID. This is usually referred to as consumption reporting. Added bonus if POs or shipping info is attached.\nhave multipe \"hard\" hold systems - i.e. once a container id is on x hold it can only be changed in the system by those super admins.\nNone of these features are usually cheap and require investment in hardware + personnel training and most companies usually try to get some combination of all features to avoid paying the full package."

Wondering if anyone can help me figure out why these Jell-O shots turned out to look like gravy \ud83d\ude02\nThey were made using standard Jell-O shot procedure- only ingredients were regular/unflavored gelatin, water, vodka, and pomegranate juice. They were the same shade of red as the pom juice when they were mixed, and then as they started to firm up, they turned this lovely shade of gravy brown. They also tasted more herbal than expected, people were not able to discern them as pomegranate flavored unless they were told ahead of time.\nAny ideas on how/why this could have happened? We are very confused hahaha. Thank you!!!!",

They were both significantly over our internal benchmark for OAL. I was honestly thrilled! But then the Marketing associate on this project basically went on a tirade on how disappointing these results were, how they weren\u2019t confident they could sell these to markets or even launch, etc etc. So now I feel like I dropped the ball, even though I know these are still decent results.\nHow do you get over this as a product developer without letting it hurt my confidence in my performance/ability? I know consumers and Marketing are fickle in general and you can\u2019t always trust a CLT to reflect actual in-market performance, but it\u2019s disheartening to feel like I missed the mark after all the time I spent developing these.

What you\u2019re looking for isn\u2019t impossible to make but it probably won\u2019t taste good or hold itself together as a bar.\nWith that said, if you are hyper focused on a bar format, just mix stuff together and see what happens.

I see two main justifications for this floating around:\nFreezing doesn't kill bacteria, it only pauses their growth. There seems to be an inbuilt assumption that the food has been thawed unsafely (i.e. outside the fridge), which is a sensible assumption for public messaging.\nThat the cell damage caused by the ice crystals actually increases the growth rate of bacteria after thawing, or something along those lines.\nI've always assumed it's just (1) and the idea is to have a simple rule that people, especially those who don't understand the science, can easily remember and follow. Based on that, in certain circumstances I have no issue with refreezing things. I have no trouble accepting (1) as an explanation because it relies on the well-known fact that bacteria reproduce more slowly at lower temperatures.\nI've never seen any reliable source for (2). The cynical part of me thinks this is a post-rationalisation of the rule being so absolute, based on their knowledge that cell-wall damage is what causes fruit and veg to change texture after freezing.\nSo, what's the real reason for the rule: 1, 2, or something else? I'd love to see a reliable authoritative source for the answer too!",

In the summer, cows graze on fresh grass, in the winter they keep indoors and are fed on hay. This affects the qualities of the butter. Summer butter tends to be thinner and lower in saturated fat compared to winter butter. This might affect the way you use it in the kitchen. It's not the temperature in your home that's affecting things, it's just that your home temperature is correlated to the overall weather, the quality of the cows' feed, and in turn the quality of your butter.\nJust a possibile explanation. The milk and butter supply chain is also complicated and butter can be frozen for a long time. It's also possible that you're eating summer butter in winter sometimes."

(Why we use them to 'tan' leather,) This gives us a bit of a pucker as well as drying sensation in the mouth.\nAcids tend to activate the salivary glands, which can make food seem less dry. Classic dishes like Veal piccata use lemon and capers to make the lean cutlets of lean veal more palatable.\nSchezwan pepper creates a numbing effect on the tongue, making spicy hot food seem spicier.\nCarbon dioxide bubbles in beer, wine, sodas, and some other products like fermented veggies and cheeses add a prickle to the tongue that makes things taste a little more lively.\nAlcohol and fat dissolve and carry different flavors, in different ways than water. (The most common flavor vehicle.) This is why perfumers use distillation and enfleurage to concentrate aroma, and why Vodka sauce does not taste the same without the Vodka!\nLots of other interesting possibilities here. We know very little about how taste and smell work empirically. Most of sensory analysis tends to be hands on, (so to speak,) since our understanding of the hard science still lags behind practice.\nIf you are interested in learning more I recommend: Nose Dive, by Harold McGee, and Flavorama by Arielle Johnson."

I don\u2019t have personal experience using insect protein in formulations or anything though so those are just things I\u2019ve heard. To get cricket protein to be widely used in the US I think, at least, you\u2019d have to get the flavor really bland, make it functionally disappear in an application, and make the price beat dairy and non dairy proteins before mass adoption could really happen. Definitely an uphill battle. Having said that, it will be interesting to see if some of that does happen. Protein is in such incredible demand right now that maybe now is the time.

Other parts of the industry are sometimes more flexible with chem, microbio, biochem, and chem E BS/MSes.\nWhat undergrad science courses have you taken? If you have basic chem (intro, organic 1/2), intro microbio, and maybe biochem, you might be able to get conditional admission to a FS MS where you'd take a couple of the core undergrad courses like food chem and food analysis first, then move into a traditional MS program. You'll be solid in the probability/stats parts of sensory work as-is, given your background. I've seen some people hop from a psych bachelor's to a sensory-focused FS master's - more conceptual overlap than you may think.\nSensory-focused degrees are generally something you'd do full-time as a research(thesis)-based master's, so employer tuition reimbursement may not work because you'd have to quit your job. Most departments are small enough that classes are limited to M-F during business hours. There are some online, part-time MS degrees like K-State's, but sensory really isn't an online-friendly part of the industry.\nTL;DR:\nwould most likely need to quit your job and get an MS in FS, potentially with an undergrad catch-up class or two. A research-based master's should be funded and have a stipend, though funding is much more limited than it used to be because of lots of (mostly federal) grants being revoked. IME, sensory roles require a graduate degree more often than other ones."

In some sense, I set out to do that, but I wasn't expecting for it to happen so early - I was mostly considering that I'd end up starting one maybe 5 to 10 years of corporate experience. There's a whole story to how I even ended up in food science (I already had a B.S. and M.S. in Chemistry before I even learned that food science was an academic field), but I can just sideline that to focus on your question.\nWhat ended up happening was that I had enrolled in a Ph.D. program in food science, and within a year or two learned that I was not cut out for research. So I ended up getting demotivated with actual education/research part of my program. And so I started doing some small things to keep myself occupied, like for example writing some blog posts for the IFT Student Association and doing small consulting projects with local food businesses.\nWell, I ended up really liking the writing, and after several years, started running the blog with a team of volunteers and optimizing the posts. I was also still doing consulting projects on the side as I started telling people here and there, which eventually led to me consulting for a medium-sized flavor company. All of the writing paid off because a publisher then reached out to me and asked if I'd want to write a\nbook\n. Again, this is all just randoms stuff I cobbled together because I was bored.\nAnd then the pandemic hit in the last year of my program, and I was having a hard time finding a job. So I just started cold emailing different CEOs at some food startups and said I could do some consulting projects with them, here were the things I'd done that I'd posted on my website, just as a way to tide me over during my job search. And that actually worked really well, and I eventually grew it to give a real annual income.\nNever got a job by the way. I think my resume looks too ridiculous to have any fathomable employment. Cool thing is that I recently got a part-time adjunct position teaching Food Entrepreneurship and Alternative Proteins though. And then there's the\nflavor documentary\nthat I'm working on as well.

I've been thinking and considering a lot of different options, and one of the ones that has seemed the most attractive to me is switching majors and pursuing food science. If I were to go down this path, I'd have two options; stay at my current school and switch to a chemistry degree, or transfer to a school with a food science program. If I do end up pursuing food science, I think I'd probably go for a master's degree regardless of which option I go with.\nThere'd be a lot of benefit to staying at my current school, even though it doesn't have a food science program. It's an extremely prestigious liberal arts college, and I think that it'd put me in a great spot when applying to graduate programs. It's resources, faculty, and opportunities really are amazing, and I have no doubt I'd be able to participate in (albeit unrelated to food) research with the professors during my undergraduate program. I also have yet to take a college chemistry or biology course yet, and despite that I'd still be able to easily graduate on time if I do switch majors. However, although I don't hate chemistry and can do it fairly well, because of my experience with AP chemistry in high school, I think I'd still end up suffering a lot during my undergraduate program, similar to what I am currently experience with math, which isn't good since thats what led me to my crisis and burnout currently. But part of me also thinks that if I truly dislike studying chemistry that much, I also wouldn't even like food science and that I only like the idea of it.\nIf I were to transfer to a school with a food science program, I think I'd definitely enjoy my undergraduate experience a lot more, with taking classes about topics in food that genuinely interest me and my passion. I also like the idea of a broader major like food science that'd allow me to \"sample\" different areas within the field to help get a better idea in what I want to specialize in. But I have doubts whether most schools with a food science program would be able to set me up for success as well as my current school for applying to graduate programs, let alone put me in a better spot. Would I be able to secure research positions at another school? I also am struggling to on how to identify which schools would be the best/top choices for me if I am pursuing a master's degree in food science.\nI'd appreciate any insights or perspectives you guys might have. Should I stay? Transfer? Transfer only if I get into a top choice and stay otherwise? Anything else I should know? Like literally anything else, I'd appreciate any and all info and advice.",

Most courses and most roles in this industry are chem-heavy. Some exceptions for some DOE/stats people in sensory science, and safety/fermentation microbio people (but still some chem there).

While many focus on the animal aspect, in the US at least, there is an initial inspection before animals are approved for slaughter so anything obviously diseased is often caught, and if not, retained. The zoonotic disease risk is low.\nBut what fewer consider are the chemicals used for cleaning the plant after slaughter days. I know at least three who are dealing with similar cancers and were around similar disinfectants. And, as expected, they don't have the time, energy, or money to try to find a link and prove it. So while anecdotal, if you talk to food inspectors who ever stayed somewhere for years on end, they likely will have a health concern (speaking from more anecdotal tales from other plants).\nThat said, processing is a bit better, and depending what you want to do, it's a good foot in the door. For many, they don't stay long enough for those concerns. So it can be a worthwhile start, but consider long term where you may end up and their use of chemicals."

        "body": "Hi all - food scientist of 15 years coming with a question totally outside of my area of expertise! I come from the candy world where calculating nutrition has been very straightforward, at least in my experience (Atwater system). That being said, I've worked purely in product development and only ever calculated nutrition very early in the process to get a general idea, never for true labeling purposes.\nHow are companies using resistant wheat starch for low calorie/keto bread and pasta calculating their calories? Anyone work at companies using this ingredient that can weigh in on this?\nFrom what I see online, resistant starch is 2.4 kcal/gram. But that's not how it adds up running the math on these labels - they seem to be only including calories from net carbs. Is there science that supports the kcal from the resistant starch not being included?\nLewis Bake Shop Healthy Life Keto Burger Buns, for instance.\n1 bun is 53 grams, 70 calories. 2g fat, 10g protein, 18g total carbohydrate, 16g of which is dietary fiber. The pack says 1g net carbs. If the 16g dietary fiber is all from the resistant starch, that alone would add ~40 kcal to the total if we're assuming 2.4kcal/gram, but the protein and fat (and 1g net carb) are already contributing over 60 kcal.\nCarbe Diem pasta is another. 56g serving for 110 kcal. .5g from fat, 8g protein, and 40g carbohydrates (16g net carb). Adding just the calories from fat, protein, and net carbs comes to just over 100kcal. The 24g of dietary fiber though, should that be adding another 57.6 kcal?\nThis came up in discussion with a friend that has been trying to lose weight. They came across a comment on Reddit (in a healthy eating subreddit I think) saying that the labeled calories on products like these may be misrepresenting what humans are actually getting from them. It led me to explain how I'm familiar with nutritionals being calculated, then running the numbers myself and getting confused and... Well, it brought me here.",
        "top_comment": "Calories/gram depends of the type of resistant starch. They are probably using an RS-4 type like Fibersym which is only 0.4 calories/gram. Also, getting almost 100% of your daily value in one serving sounds like a recipe for disaster unless you work your way up to it."

At the end of the day it\u2019s a numbers game right now and it\u2019s extremely helpful to have connections. After February typically the job market opens back up again.\nA few tips for your resume - for your internships maybe add a line on what the company made/did it\u2019s very helpful for interviewers to have that context before reading your accomplishments there. Your resume reads quality heavy and poises you as someone who would slide well into quality technician type work. If that\u2019s what you want great! If it\u2019s not then consider how you might reframe some of your work experiences to match up with R&D responsibilities - for instance reframing your research project and how you wrote your design of experiments, how you executed your testing, what the results of the testing were, how you tested, recorded and summarized the data and most importantly what challenges you faced and how you overcame them."

It\u2019s my understanding that the proteins in the eggs are responsible for the shine due to the protein coagulation and film forming properties. And the Maillard reaction is just the reaction between the reducing sugars and proteins. So what I\u2019ve done is use a combination of protein+fat+sugar+ various film forming ingredients to promote shine. So far I\u2019ve mixed in ultrastik and high acyl gellan gum into various formulations of faba bean protein concentrate +oil+dextrose+. And I\u2019m not getting a significantly deep browning nor a significant sign.\nBoth are better than my control, but nothing close to egg. I\u2019ve tried using the protein anywhere from 10%-20%, the ultrastik from 5%-10%, the oil around 10%-12%, sugar at 5-10% and gellan gum at such a small amount to where it barely effects viscosity.

I may just be looking for someone that can pick out exact wording in this portion of the CFR better than I can rn to help me keep it clear in my brain and not doubt myself on it.\nOverall I believe I understand the NOP regulations pretty well, I just get a little hung up/hesitant on things like ground spices/purees/\u201cfoodstuff\u201d type items that do not count as natural flavorings and want to get some confirmation.\nLet\u2019s say R&D wants to use a non-organic berry puree in a 95%+ organic certified material. They have been unable to find an organic certified version of this specific berry puree. They would then need it to be NOP compliant to use in that 5%. They find a source and want to know if it is NOP compliment - we receive a NOID from the supplier confirming some of the the usual (non-GMO, not irradiated/treated with ETO, no sewage sludge used, no prohibited solvents/additives/processing aids).\nIf this was a berry extract it would be OK for compliance if our documentation checked out for natural flavoring and all and no prohibited extraction solvents/additives used, and also keeping in mind it needs to go through commercial review process to have documented proof there is not an organic equivalent available on the market right now.\nDoes this stance change if it is a puree/is not considered a flavoring substance? Does it then need to fall specifically in 205.606 to be used in certified materials and counts more as an agricultural product (rather than non-agricultural where flavors lie) or is this okay generally by default since it is non-synthetic?\nWhen I read through, I want to take it as no - this could not be considered NOP compliant if not a flavor. It would need to fall on 205.606. This also seems to be how it would read for things like black pepper, ground cinnamon, etc (again assuming someone could not find an organic version, sorry I\u2019m using some pretty commonly available organic spices there, pretend they are less common haha). But I am also seeing a lot of things note that non-synthetic substances are ok if not available organically unless prohibited (205.602 and 205.604). So then it makes me doubt that and feel I am overthinking, and it would be okay if not synthetic / no prohibited methods or substances used.\nAnyone have thoughts on this to help me sort my brain out? Sorry this is probably such a silly question ah. I tried to cover this as \u201cin general everything else checks out for NOP compliance, but what if it\u2019s a puree and not a flavor.\u201d",
        "top_comment": "You are correct, in a product labeled \"organic,\" for the ingredients above the 95% organic ag ingredients: only agricultural ingredients on 205.606 would be compliant and there has to be a commercial availability search to show no organic was available prior to using."

Do universities that develop food products for entrepreneurs, are the scientists on their team actually well versed to handle tough projects or are they generally less knowledgeable about food development vs a seasoned independent professional?\nI love the structure of the proposal that the university has given me, but I worry about the lack of expertise and am scared to fork thousands of dollars to an noobie food scientist student that doesn't have much experience (ex: kids running around in a lab).\nPlease help me decide and explain to me if my thought is actually wrong. I can't find much info on how well qualified universities are in developing food products, so I am not certain. If someone actually knows about this in more detail and can advise me, I'd genuinely appreciate it.",
        "top_comment": "Hello, just chipping in. I've got experience working in product development for corporations and startups. Worked with a lot of labs, not-for-profit labs, for-profit labs, pilot labs, industrial research centers; and freelancers, also freelancers with labs. The spectrum is wide.\nUnis:\nHard to say but some uni departments can be highly specialized in the domain of your product. For example, a flavor science department tends to work on projects from different industries, but they may be specialized in baked goods due to historical reasons or due to continued support from a generous sponsor or customer in the baking industry .\nThe uni approach also tends to be highly analytical and very good at showing (with data) why your food production method or formulation works or doesn't work. Uni labs tend to have\na lot\nof equipment for testing and/or making your product. But it does take time to study your request, set up experiments, collect and analyze data, and finally to make conclusions. Usually the uni-based food labs are run by food scientists with a lot of industry experience too but their position in an academic lab might insulate them from the realities of your company, and they might only produce a minimum viable product (read as : technically sufficient, but maybe not enough personality for your brand) that you'll still need to tweak to get to launch state.\nAlso, working with unis might also allow you to unlock government funding under the right circumstances, but, in exchange, the uni might have rights to sharing your IP for educational purposes. If they're just providing analytical services in exchange for payment, then this won't be a problem.\nFreelancer :\nA freelance food scientist with a lot of industry experience can be great as an accelerator, especially if his or her experience lines up really well with the type of product you want to develop. They might already know what works and doesn't work because they've already done the analysis before or they know techniques or technologies that work to get what you need. They're usually great for getting your product concept to a launch state.\nIt's also important to look into what kind of industry experience your freelancer has - are they coming from corporate FMCG or F&B companies or from startups? are they limited to the technical aspects of product development or do they also understand the commercial aspects of product design (e.g. cost, branding, scale-friendly design, etc.). Sometimes freelancers make convoluted product or process designs because they do not have the industrial experience or they may have outdated assumptions.\nYou should also look into how they will do their work... Do they have a lab or do they work with other labs ? What kind of capabilities do they have as a freelancer? One typical downside of a freelancer is that they do not have equipment and may need to work with a uni or lab to do analysis.\nBottom line :\nIt's not really black and white and it does depend where you are as an entrepreneur.\nSpeaking as a R&D manager for a startup... I prefer to work with unis when I need technical clarity and analytical power to unravel a complex question that we simply have no bandwidth for. On the other hand, I might choose to work with a freelancer when there's a very good fit between their experience and our product domain, and they can bring a lot to the table (i.e. not just technical experience but business and brand development guidance as well). I freelance a bit too but I'm very honest with clients when my experience does not line up well with what they want to do, so they can decide whether they want to look for someone more suited for their needs."

I used recipal to log the ingredients in the recipe, most of which are processed foods with multiple ingredients (like sweetener blends and fortified protein powders). Based on the feedback I received, I have 2 concerns: 1) Am I calculating the caloric content of the sugar alcohols incorrectly? I'm using more than a \\\"0 cal\\\" serving, so I'm thinking there might be some unaccounted calories from the sugar alcohols, but even then it seems like it would only be an extra 5-10 cals. 2) Is it not correct practice to list the ingredients with all of their sub ingredients? I don't want to disclose the exact products I used in my recipe, but I'm also not trying to hide the fact that I used prepared products in my formula.

        "body": "Hi experts and scientists!\nI have a question for you guys:\nI am working with pectin products. Whenever there\u2019s a certain dose of Calcium related ingredients (B5, TCP etc) that have to be added. The HM pectin solution will instantly become a slushy type of mixture. I assumed that it was an induced gelation led by Ca2+. However, heating it up will not reverse this gel. And thus the pectin now loses all its ability to form gels even after acid. I wanna learn what this is and how to avoid that.\nQuestion\n^\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nAlso, LM pectin (including amidated) tend to shrink its face when being exposed to a pH below 3.7? Noticeable viscosity and stirring resistance increase are encountered after pH being dropped past 3.8. When the pH is too low past 3.2-3.3 it will gel locally and irreversibly therefore lose its ability to form a calcium induced gel.\nAm I right about the second paragraph?\nBest,\nSomeone",
        "top_comment": "Question: What temperature are you at when you add your Ca+ to your HM Pectin syrup?\nCa+ don't normally affect HM Pectin that quickly, assuming you have high sugar solid (55-85%) and low pH (2 5-3.8). Held at 90C down to 80C, no pre-gelling occurs in my experience. (Slow Set for Gummies)\nThe same scenario in LM, the higher the concentration of Ca+, the higher the gelling temperature is required (up until Ca+ saturation point), so there's a limit around 30 mg Ca++ / g pectin.\nCommercial LM are usually Amidated (LMA).\nHigher degree of amidation, higher gellation temp required for high Ca+ mixtures."

        "top_comment": "Depends on the end products. Emulsions are wet and are significantly more complex than most dry blending. Since you said beverages it very likely means there is very little in the way of order of addition or even mix parameters, and you can't really overmix (but you also don't want to waste time). Depending on what sort of dry blends you were doing order of addition and mix time could have been critical process parameters.\nBeverage/dilute liquid blending is a lot of flavor work in development and when it comes to process it's all about efficiency for your specific facility. e.g. turning a 6hr mix into an 8hr mix from excessive premixes or liquid addition changes loses you a whole batch per day.\nSome tips:\nCold process everything you can\nIf it's soluble, it's soluble. You don't have to wait to proceed (usually).\nIf you can spec a particle size from your vendor, figure out the minimum that won't fisheye or clump.\nPre-disperse colloids in insoluble liquids that are miscible with the base for rapid hydration.\nMix times mostly do not need to scale if your commercial vessel has good top to bottom churn. Having a refractometer on a recirculating loop will demonstrate this and provide assurance.\nLearn about impeller types and their applications."

        "top_comment": "Could also be poor supplier vetting/using ingredients that should have a thermal kill step in the finished product. I've seen a\nlot\nof wellness startups ignore glaring food safety issues from ingredient vendors or use ingredients that are not RTE in RTE products.\nFor something like infant botulism, it can be caused by a fairly small number of\nC. bot\nspores. An adult digestive system wouldn't have issues with that, so we'd normally see \"powdered drink mix,\" see its very low water activity, and not consider botulism a risk, at least for adults. I'd probably be more concerned about\nSalmonella\nin a powder for adults. I'd assume most formula manufacturers just rely on ingredient/finished product testing, since heat treatment wouldn't work for this sort of product?\nI wonder if poor dust management/ventilation, either on supplier side or finished manufacturer side, caused this. 23 cases is wild. I have no idea how much BabyBIG California even keeps stocked? This would be around a third of the typical annual volume used, and infant botulism cases are typically one-offs from honey or random dust/dirt, not outbreaks.\nI'm also used to seeing startup-type outbreaks revealing shared co-mans when the recall involves multiple brands, but this one actually sounds more \"DIYed,\" which surprised me. I would've thought baby formula, of all things, would be highly likely to use a co-man because it's so specific and regulated.\nByHeart was notified by the FDA on November 7, 2025 of an estimated 83 cases of infant botulism that were reported nationwide since August 2025.\nWe normally see around 100-150 infant cases a year. So even if not all 83 are linked to one product, 83 cases in 3 months is unusually high."

Except...\nNow, I have a new issue where as it continues to fry (seen in the second picture) it loses its shape and begins to expand out, almost as if it's a balloon that's being inflated too much.\nLastly, the other new issue I'm dealing with (third picture) is that they're completely deflate and sink in once they come out of the fryer. They were also very soggy to the touch, whereas the handmade and star shaped ones tend to be much firmer to the touch.\nWhat could be some possible troubleshooting to fix these issues? Could it be too large of a quantity of leavening agents? Too much binder? Too much moisture?\nI feel like I'm really close here, but I simply lack the experience to know what adjustment makes the most sense here. I greatly appreciate any insight.",
        "top_comment": "Im guessing its more of the main flour you use, what is it? For donuts like product which has high moisture content, the dough needs to hold itself together well. Thats why wheat is the best choice since it has the gluten protein for its structure. Other than that, you can only rely on starch properties of the main flour and additives like cmc, xanthan gums, etc. So try to play along with different flours (probably the ones with amylopectin not too high like rice or corn flour would work better) and the ratio of additives.

        "body": "I've created a high-protein cake that I'd like to sell - I'm looking to start small (selling from home under cottage food law as a sole proprietor), and scale up organically to meet demand. My essential startup costs are under 1K - mostly permits/licenses and initial batches of ingredients and packaging. However, it's critical that I'm able to make nutrition claims from the start, as the protein and calorie contents of the product are essential - anyone can make a cake, but it's fairly challenging to make a good tasting cake with 40g protein and only 240 cals. I've found that nutrition analysis in a lab generally costs well over 1K, and I'd much rather hold off on this sort of larger expense until I've established interest in the product and made some consistent sales. Is there any way to get it done cheaper? I've already made a basic nutrition label using recipal - is it illegal to use this as a nutrition label right away without third party verification that it's accurate? Sorry if this is a really ignorant question - I'm new to navigating food entrepreneurship.",
        "top_comment": "Where are you planning to sell this?\nIf it\u2019ll be in a grocery store you should have a food scientist look at it. A good consultant is more or less $200/hr and you can expect a few hours of their time to meet and talk through the formula and process to make sure your label is accounting for things like moisture loss. If you\u2019re making a protein claim you\u2019d want to calculate out the PDCAAS score to make sure you are claiming the right amount of protein especially if you are calling it \u201chigh protein\u201d on the front of pack. Beyond Meat actually ran into this issue somehow claiming a very high amount of protein in an early version of their burgers that was just pea protein (which is not a complete protein). This is generally when it\u2019s a good idea to hire a food scientist.\nYou\u2019ll also want this person to be able to advise you on allergen declaration so they\u2019ll need to see the specifications of what ingredients you are using and ask you about where you are making these for the \u201cmay contains\u201d allergen statement.\nIt\u2019s not illegal for you to sell it with your own label from recipal but know that if someone challenges you on it, and takes you to court (not likely as you are small) then you\u2019d need to substantiate the label to defend yourself and that\u2019s when a nutritional analysis may be conducted. This is why most big companies are very careful about their labels, they\u2019re trying to avoid a lawsuit. I\u2019ve seen many, MANY, cottage food companies make horrible errors on their label (obvious stuff like calling something gluten-free when they have definitely added barley to the ingredients).I\u2019ve also had to fix a lot of homemade labels when I consulted.\nIf you\u2019re selling at like a farmers market or a restaurant you don\u2019t need a label. It\u2019s certainly nice to have one but not a must."

It's unlikely sugar syrup with some ginger, spices, and orange peel will get close to that, so you'd need to add an acid. The product should be able to maintain its pH over time - some products will start to see pH change as they sit.\nSince it looks like you're in the US, you'd be operating under your state's cottage food regulations. They'll likely require your product to have a safe pH and heat treatment, and they won't allow use of a preservative to get around those requirements. My state allows 1:1 syrups with added flavor (i.e. higher water activity), but they must be below a pH of 4.6 and follow proper hot fill hold procedure."

        "body": "Nan lent me a book about home management from the 30s (1934 if I\u2019m correct) and it talks about a technology I\u2019ve never heard anything about for food preservation.\nIs there any truth here? Or is it all a scam?\nThe book is called \u201cThe Home of To-day\u201d and is from the UK, if that helps.\nPhotos of the pages:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/uomtb3P\nText:\n\u201cPreserving food by wave-length\nSo rapid are the advances of science today that it seems quite natural to hear of a new discovery which, when generally\napplied, will revolutionise the refrigeration industry.\nThis is nothing less than an ether wave set up by a special apparatus which will cause a resistance to decay in food.\nThe wave is originated by the intermingling of two air currents of different electric potentialities\nThe installation consists of a\n\"generator\" and a \"radiator\" of very special con-struction.\nWhen the apparatus is installed in the home, it will safeguard all foods from decay and deterioration.\nThe ether wave emitted has a\nparalysing effect on certain types of germs preventing them from multiplying and thus causing decay. The wave also develops a resistance to decay in the substance treated, so that the food will be rendered practically imperishable after treatment.\nMoreover, this ether wave protects the\n\"favour\" of delicate foods to a remarkable degree, and is thus very valuable where finely-flavoured foods have to be kept for a considerable time. Experiments with delicately flavoured fruits, such as pears of the Beurre variety, have proved that whereas these pears will not keep usually more than nine or ten days after picking, if treated with the ether wave they will remain absolutely fresh and flavoursome for a month.\nThis remarkable preservation discovery is still at the experimental stage, and most curious and interesting results are being obtained by using different wave-lengths.\nThe following are particularly interesting results of experiments with ether-wave preservation:\nA large dairy association in Amsterdam put some pasteurised milk, showing 50-70 germs per cubic centimetre, in a \" cool cell\" of 2\u00b0 Centigrade. Another portion of the same milk was kept under the influence of the \"ether wave.\" After ten days the samples were compared. Both were fit for human consumption at the time of release, but the \" cool-cell\" sample showed 120,000 germs, and the \" ether-wave \" sample only 170. Half an hour later the \" cool-cell\" sample was undrinkable,\nbut the \" ether-wave\" sample was perfectly good after 2 1/2 days standing in the laboratory.\nAnother interesting result from experiments with milk is that under ether-wave treatment the acidity degree decreases with keeping instead of slowly increasing in the normal manner. It is thought that this indicates that for a time the development of the lactic-acid germ is absolutely stopped. At present this action is limited, although in time a wave-length may be discovered which will prolong the non-development of the germ indefinitely.\nWith eggs, very satisfactory results have been obtained, the ether-wave treatment\nresulting in eggs being kept \" new laid\" from three to six months.\nThis ether wave shows two opposite magnetic poles with inverse attraction, and it has been found that the contraction or shrinkage of perishable foods is greater in a very short wave-length of 10-12 inches than in a long wave-length of 30 inches or more. It is therefore necessary to study the length of the wave when treating various types of foods, and the research chemists are busy defining these points.\nBefore very long we may look forward to\nthe general use of this new method of preservation, and ether-wave apparatas will be as common in the home as wireless is already, and just as simple to operate.\u201d",
        "top_comment": "Absolute bs but very interesting read\nEdit: in the context of high energy radiation some of the stuff does check out, mainly killing bacteria. \nIt\u2019s currently used for spices with flavors that are sensitive to heat so actually, yeah. This is real and currently used in the food industry.\nSome of the claims aren\u2019t really accurate, and are quite exaggerated. The whole egg thing can\u2019t be true because if it was it would be a complete game changer. But again, we do actually use this for spices. We just don\u2019t call it ether."

And, you\u2019re not doing a lot of real food science work. It\u2019s mostly policy work.\nI used to do want to do this work myself but the reality is this kind of work is poorly funded so it\u2019s pretty hard to get a job doing this and you have to be 100% okay with not making much money and knowing that your job may be cut at any time.\nI volunteered for Farmer to Farmer programs which was a USAID program that was cut under the new presidential administration. \u00a0It was a great program where you can go to developing countries and bring your food science expertise to help them better their food processes and systems. Unfortunately these programs don\u2019t exist anymore for the foreseeable future.\nBut you can still read about these programs and what they\u2019ve done in the past to get a better sense of what kind of assignments they\u2019ve done. I did two assignments, one in Guatemala and one in Honduras (I am a Spanish speaker so that helped).\nIf you\u2019re looking at global food insecurity, learn French and Spanish. If you are interested in local, at least Spanish.\nMost food insecurity work is going to be based around building policy, like I said. Consider taking classes in Public Health or getting a MPH."

It can only strengthen cell walls that are already there.  A cucumber is already crispy and CaCl helps it maintain some of that when pickling.\nIf you're starting with a green banana and want to maintain that firmness it might help but depending on how you are cooking it might not at all. It also might just create an unpleasant fuzziness of pectin build up around the outside of the fruit.  It might also start a reaction that turns the whole thing into a gel.  It will not be like a dehydrated or deep fried banana.\nThat said, 0.05% is a good starting point.  CaCl is exothermic so gets hot with moisture.  It won't do much to a large batch, but can burn your skin, eyes, mouth.  If you get powder, wear gloves and don't taste it or breathe it in.  Post updates with successes and failures!  Good luck."

Anyway, all that being said, I\u2019ve become a bit stubborn to leave the CIA because coming here is something I\u2019ve set my sights on for so long. So I was wondering if having a culinary degree could help me at all be more desirable for future career opportunities or should I just quit the CIA and go do the food science degree program at NCSU so I can purse what I want to do in the future?",
        "top_comment": "My recommendation is don\u2019t go into debt to also become a chef.  The Food Science degree alone will pay off in spades.  NC State has amazing programs and is particularly famous for its Sensory program, for example.  I would not do the CIA\u2019s Food Science Program.\nIf money is no object and becoming a trained chef is a passion, go for it.  But becoming a chef doesn\u2019t have a good Return on Investment.  The culinary skillset is valued in technochef positions and the mindset is great but it doesn\u2019t \u201cpay.\u201d\nThe Food Science degree has endless opportunities!"

I almost gag sometimes. This happens with all types of bread except for french bread (like the loafs at the walmart bakery lol) and bread that is warm/cooked (like in a grilled cheese or most garlic breads). Types of bread that regularly make me feel nauseous are white sandwich bread, wheat sandwich bread, sourdough bread, and bagels. These types of bread in a grilled cheese do NOT make me feel nauseous. I also have a similar experience with flour tortillas, however I don't feel nauseous with something like a frozen burrito. Obviously this all points at some gluten/flour related problem but I don't have any issues after eating? Once it's swallowed it's all good. And I don't have any of these issues with pasta at all.

Does the alcohol in the end denature all nutrients and vitamins in the end anyway?

So it's not like an entire department specializes just in canned food.\n\"Sugar free\" can be pretty broad, as that could be anything from candy to beverages to baked goods.\nWisconsin is well-known for candy, esp.

PA as a whole has a decent number of small to midsize contract manufacturers, esp. in chips/snacks and retort processing, but a decent number of them are less urban, like around York/Harrisburg.\nIf you're focused on PD, my biggest callout is that you'll generally be limited to companies' headquarters locations, either main HQ or a US one. Whereas for QA/QC, safety/auditing, etc., you could work for an employer in any place where they have a plant, though they're often more rural.\nKeep an eye out for contract manufacturers. They often have a very limited online presence, but most have a small PD team to develop formulas and make samples for customers. Similarly, retailers also have smaller PD teams for their private label items, and restaurant chains have PD too.\nOverall, none of those cities are red flags. Though Ann Arbor would have the smallest industry job market, it's also a smaller town, so it might even out. And regardless, the job market nationwide sucks right now.

However defatted soy flour has 1.3 to 1.5 grams of fat per 100 grams, compared to white flour being 1 gram, iirc. I believe these numbers are correct.\nWould there be any reason you guys can see why soy flour would not be able to make a long lasting, shelf stable product like regular hard tack?",

        "top_comment": "It's a nuanced subject for sure never mind going into details about other significant changes from humidity affecting yeast proliferation especially in the case of sourdough etc.\nI wouldn't use relative humidity to explore this rather absolute humidity is a better analysis of what the microbes are going to experience. Basically your trying to track moisture content for hydration which is difficult when like you said is changing based on different humidities.\nThermodynamically for every 1\u00b0C increase in temperature you can hold 7% more water. This means that at 20\u00b0C @ 70% RH you have less total water than 30\u00b0C @ 50% RH even though the relative humidity is lower.\nAdditionally flour will absorb more water when the absolute humidity is higher hence why humid places have more mold issues with storage. Something like 10g per kilo of flour of water per 30 minutes if exposed.\nYou can buy a hygrometer and adjust based on the difference. In the dead of winter average an increase of 2-3%  depending on temperature of course. In the middle of summer you can decrease 2-4% based on temperature again and absolute humidity.\nIt looks like a 0.01 increase in Aw something like that and you get a bunch of other increases in enzymatic, yeast, bacteria etc. So if you are basing it off RH then remember a 2\u00b0C increase at the same RH means AH goes up 15%!! Pretty huge jump.\nOther things you can do Is measure flour before and after one night open to see the difference in humidity in summer."

Over the next day, the solid casein had almost completely turned into a thick white liquid. Over the next week, as it dried, the liquid turned yellow, then orange, and eventually dark brown, once it had completely solidified. Additionally, many fissures had formed within the brown solid, which is likely from evaporation, since the container was a tall plastic cup that was open at the top. I understand most of the reactions that occurred, but I\u2019m lost as to what caused their mixture to turn brown with a surface smooth enough to reflect light (plastic facing side).\nDetails I think I understand:\nBromelain in the pineapple juice hydrolyzed the solid casein proteins, making it easier for them to dissolve back into residual water.\nThe color change is correlated with dehydration, as the sides of the container had a thin layer of the mixture, and that changed color noticeably sooner.\nDetails I\u2019d like to understand:\nWhat the causes of the color change and solidification are\nWhat the final product is\nA.I. credits this product to the Maillard reaction. While I believe that\u2019s possible, I was skeptical enough to ask Reddit. I\u2019m unfamiliar with the Maillard reaction, and while sugars and amino acids/peptides are present, I\u2019m uncertain whether it is expected to occur at room temperature in a pH range caused by pineapple juice.",

The powder itself has a fantastic, vibrant L\na\nb color value and it's a key selling point. I'm determined to preserve it in the final product. The issue is that once it's in a solution (water, pH adjusted to 6.5), it begins to oxidize and brown within days, even under refrigeration in an opaque bottle. The taste holds up, but we lose that incredible color.\nSo beyond ascorbic acid (which is affecting the taste), what is the most effective industry-standard method for preserving chlorophyll in a high-water-activity beverage?

When an internal opening for a trainee flavorist appears, apply, interview, and hope you get it.\nMS or PhD in food science, specific to flavor chemistry or sensory science. Get a job as a trainee flavorist.\nThe trainee programs are typically five years, sometimes one or two more. It's essentially an apprenticeship under a senior flavorist. Note that these roles sometimes aren't posted externally - this chunk of the industry is pretty small, so an academic pedigree from a well-known lab is what would get you in the door, or the other \"start as a compounder and hopefully work your way up.\"\nKind of reminds me of two common routes for a chef: start as a dishwasher or line cook and work your way up, or go to culinary school, do a couple of internships/stages, and hope one sticks. But in this case, the \"culinary school\" equivalent (MS/PhD) at least has a stipend for you, instead of you paying out the nose for a culinary degree. :)"

It's different from the typical pepper heat, as adding peppers adds a distinctly different flavor, instead of enhancing the heat from the ginger. I've read that this is due to gingerol, but there seems to be a lot of conflicting information on how to add more of this or isolate it in some way. I've tried making a ginger extract using mashed ginger and vodka, but this has resulted in something more like a gingery vodka as opposed to a vanilla extract type of product.\nSo my questions are, where does the ginger heat come from, and what are the fundamental concepts behind isolating or extracting gingerol (if this is where it comes from)? Happy to do more research on how to enhance this characteristic in my ginger beer, I just don't know where to even start.",
        "top_comment": "I was in charge of developing ginger NoLo drinks for a company a couple of years back. So I can add a few points here :)\nGingerols are what gives ginger its front, sharp, kind of \"green\" tasting heat. Shogaols are another class of compound that give heat but it's softer, warmer, like ginger powder heat. There's also zingerone which is also a rather cooked heat (again like ginger powder). Shogaols actually form from gingerols when it loses water in a chemical reaction (dehydration) as a result of drying or cooking. So if you want that fresh ginger heat, you should go for cold pressed ginger juices. If you want that warm, slightly sweet ginger heat, then you cook it. Ginger typically also has differences in heat depending on maturity, crop elevation, and cultivar. There are varieties that pack more heat because there's more gingerol per gram of ginger root."

I need a low-starch thickener because I follow a low-starch diet for autoimmune issues. Don't want to use gums.\nDoes anyone know if I can use glucomannan as a thickener for this purpose? And, if so, does it need a little hot water in the process to activate it? I see that it clumps so I could mix it with some sugar first. I'd rather not heat up the coconut yoghurt.\nFor 1 cup of the yoghurt plus 1 x 30gram serve of protein powder, I was thinking 1 teaspoon of glucomannan may be the right amount.\nAny thoughts?\nthank you!",

        "top_comment": "Partially drying the nuts before putting them in the oil may help. The oil is losing heat because it's using that energy to convert water into steam. Less water --> less energy displaced. You could remove the nuts from the sugar solution, drain well, then store under a heat lamp while they're waiting to fry in batches. Increasing the sugar concentration in your solution may help too by reducing the moisture content in the nut. A tiny bit of baking soda may help too. Raising the pH would induce more Maillard browning, meaning the nuts need less time in the oil to brown (though it might not give you the shiny gloss you're looking for)."

Would that be physiologically effective or just marketing fluff?\nWould love to hear from anyone with expertise in food science, nutrition, or metabolism on how these mechanisms actually work.",
        "top_comment": "Measurable? Yes.\nSignificant w.r.t. to a caloric deficit for weight loss? No.\nYes, stuff like capsaicin does increase the heart rate and therefore the metabolic rate. But, as said, that's just as much marketing as adding B vitamins.\nedit: Taking it into perspective\nDrinking ice cold water does increase your thermogensis caswell. According to Brown et. al. (2006) the metabolic energy expenditure was increased by less than 5 % (over the next 60 minutes) after drinking chilled water. Assuming a basal metabolic rate of 60 kcal/h this makes up for roughly two dates a day at best. Similarly Moreno et. al. (2022) found that caffeine intake did increase the energy expenditure in a workout by less than the equivalent of three dates.\nSo to put that into perspective again: drinking an ice chilled caffeine drink and performing an workout gives you the caloric benefit of five dates (at best)... the workout alone does factor three - ten of that. So, yes, technically such methods work... but these are not what people fail at when trying to cut weight.\nDisclaimer: I assumed one dates gives roughly 30 kcal."

I've had it lab tested for three months refrigerated, which it passed with flying colours. I would like to do a similar process using pouches instead of jars. Any advice on the type of pouch I would need and any changes to the process would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks",
        "top_comment": "The challenge with pouches is to fill them without contaminating the sealing face. There's no reason why you can't do this exact same process in a pouch, but you will need a heat sealer to close the pouches. If there's soup in the interface between the two layers of plastic that get sealed together, they won't effectively seal and you'll get a leak. The plastic edges need to be in direct contact to polymerize and seal.\nYou can use a simple impulse sealer to do this. I'd suggest putting two seals, one on top of the other, just to be safe in case one fails. You'll want to buy gusseted bags that are suitable for hot liquids and ensure that the filler descends into the bag a bit so you don't risk spilling soup into the sealing face (rather than filling from above the bag opening like you might with a jar).\nThat's basically it. You might want to revalidate your shelf life since the plastic will allow some oxygen to permeate (while glass is a very strong barrier). This could impact shelf life a little.\nFor your knowledge, you are absolutely pasteurizing your soup if you're hot filling it, otherwise you wouldn't have much shelf life."

Once unfolded, proteins start to clump together forming visible coagulae.\nThis protein clump won't really work like aquafaba because these proteins are denatured and once that happens they tend to lose their functionality -- the ability to do the thing they do in food like create foams or emulsions. You could press that curd though, then fry and eat it. It will probably be fairly mild and maybe a bit bitter. Won't hurt you."

        "top_comment": "Most electrolyte drinks are a mix of real science and marketing.\nGatorade etc are mostly sugar water with a pinch of salt, stuff like lmnt (never even heard of that specific one but did a cursory search) seems to flip that with no sugar, heavy on the salt.\nFor everyday use, you don\u2019t need to spend that kind of money tbh, you can literally mix a pinch of salt, a dash of potassium salt (like lite salt which comes in many brands all across the world), and some lemon or magnesium powder into water and get the same effect for pennies. Of course do actual research into how much of what is useful and not just pseudo science blah. Too much of any of those things can get real dangerous real quick."

Best for legumes especially.\nSourdough is super effective at lowering FODMAP across the board to Low FODMAP range if you're using good quality flour that's freshly milled for feeding the sourdough and ensuring a longer fermentation cycle overnight in the fridge.\nPre soaking grains, legumes and nuts will reduce GOS content on top of other methods like sourdough and can also be effective in the 50% range. Discarding the water after is crucial as well.\nLacto fermentation can greatly decrease fructans in vegetables, lactose in the case of heirloom yogurt culture or  kefir grains and fruits as well if fermenting spontaneously.\nAlso consuming glucose with fructose will facilitate fructose absorption. 1:1 ratio or higher glucose."

I've been trying to find a good source for these kinds of questions on the internet, but it's been increasingly difficult with AI and with tiktok and instagram appearing as \"sources of information\", when it's just an influencer repeating the same thing for the nth time.\nI understand that diet sodas are not great for the teeth because of the acidic elements they contain. In my example, Pepsi Max in my country contains phosphoric acid and citric acid. It does also contain trisodium citrate though and I'm having a hard time understanding if this is supposed to be a neutralizer or maybe a \"normalizer\" of acidity levels in the drink.\nFrom what I can see they have different pH levels, so to the uneducated eye (mine) it appears like they're trying to cancel them out? Is this what it means? And how unhealthy is it for the teeth really?",
        "top_comment": "The simplest way to explain it is that the buffer prevents the pH (acid level) from changing too drastically over time, ensuring it stays fairly consistent. It does not cancel out the acids, just keeps them from changing/degrading\nThe longer that acidic foods stay on your teeth, the worse it is. If you drink the entire can of soda in a short period of time & swish with plain water afterwards, that\u2019s the safest way to consume it & maintain teeth health."

I love R&D, but the constant changes in budget availability and business directions have been exhausting to deal with. At my current position, it's impossible to get more salary, so I have to go up managerial positions or business-related positions if I want any upward mobility.\nWhat kind of knowledge and experiences (and even certificates) do I need to transition into non-R&D positions?",
        "top_comment": "You haven't even been in industry for 2 years.\nYou think budgetary changes suck as an IC? Try being the one who has to explain it to the ICs (manager). Worse, try being the one who spends days, weeks, months planning and arguing for the budget just to get short changed (Director). Even worse, try being the one who looks at the company's cash flow, reserves, P&L, order book, and the all the departments requested budgets and deciding who is going to get short changed the most (VP/C Suite).\nAnyway, if you want to take the management track I would start learning about business management. Partially to learn about business management but mostly so you can slip a bunch of superfluous jargon and acronyms into your speech. The talking heads at the top love to hear how you have the bandwidth to demonstrate your core competencies in optimizing your deliverables. It's a total game changer when you can identify when to take a conversation offline and when to circle back and touch base about the proposed paradigm shift. This will really help the CAGR of the EPS, at least for EBITDA. If you follow this advice your ROI on this CTA will show as you crush your KPIs. Ya dig?\nSorry, feeling cynical. \ud83d\ude05"

A process authority will help you figure out the right time-temperature combination to make the product safe, you don't need to bring them a finalized process.\nI highly recommend a book called Canned Foods by the Grocery Manufacturers Alliance.

You basically can\u2019t brew it. The tiny amount of cocoa solids filtering through won\u2019t contribute much flavor.\nIt\u2019s a gimmicky product and super misleading by writing 100% ground cacao. Brewing cocoa powder won\u2019t taste anything like it.\nhttps://criobru.com/products/double-chocolate\nThey\u2019re not listing their ingredients properly either. It\u2019s against FDA rules to add all the other descriptions (paleo, 100% pure ground, keto, etc.) around the ingredient names.\nEdit: I was reading the ingredients for Double Chocolate specifically.

I admit I am a little biased because im a vegan of 10 years but the global trends are clear and people are becoming more plant based. Plant based food industry is rapidly growing in Kenya for sustainability, environmental and health reasons. You would be successful if you used your expertise to make different plant-based products from locally grown crops in Kenya. Also kenya is in a very convenient location to conduct business with people in east asia, which manufactures much of machinery and equipment that you would need in kenya for any kind of food  product business..you can even fly direct to countries like Thailand and Singapore from Nairobi.

The new one is only 1 inch between trays.\nCenter crackers are coming out pale while the outsides are obviously dark from the increased air flow. It\u2019s a sveba dahlen V52 if it matters.\nIs it physically possible to get the same outcome? I increased the amount of time at the same temp but of course the crackers are super dry. I increased temp and decreased time and the outer corners only burned more.\nWhat makes it even more complicated is that it\u2019s a \u201cdouble bake\u201d. We put them in a dryer after so they\u2019ll only get dryer.",
        "top_comment": "I don\u2019t know that you\u2019re using the best type of oven for crackers.\nDirect gas fire tunnel ovens are the best to achieve and even bake for inner and outer rows and even that gets complicated because you still have to adjust airflow humidity time and temp. However if you aren\u2019t manufacturing at a large scale and you\u2019re using a rotary oven you might need to at a minimum need to space your trays out more and also if possible have different stages of temp/air flow. You want to add the most air flow at the last stage to achieve the color you want. Stage 1 establishes any leavening and rise (in other words, sets the shape), stage 2 drives out the moisture and stage 3 establishes color.\nJust some extra info, for crackers and biscuits, you want to target a total moisture content of 3%, +- 0.5% and checking for moisture distribution within each cracker to prevent surface checking (hairline cracks) \u00a0over time.\nGood luck!"

        "top_comment": "Hi, are you generally familiar with the extraction of lipophilic compounds of natural samples? \nThere are a lot of ways. It depends on what kind of analysis you want to use the cocoa butter for.\n You can achieve good results with Bligh and Dyer extraction, this is a really common method using Chloroform and also MTBE extraction methods are a good way (for example Salem et al. 2016).\nYou can also use the soxhlet extraction method with hexane it is also a really easy way to extract all the fat-components. But you have to use higher temperature  (~70 \u00b0C) and you maybe have to do another kind of extraction after the soxhlet extraction.\nI would also recommend to dry your powdered sample before, freeze drying would be optimal or an oven. Depends on which temperature you are comfortable with."

So it's the concentrate of the protein, then gelated. What exactly remains totally depends on how it was processed... and the remains should be labeld in the nutritional declaration of the very product.\nGlutene itselfe is a strong hydrocolloid which can act as emulsifier/ stabilizing agent. That's what it does in bakery goods. ;) Whatsoever it is fairly hydrophilic. But, of course, you can add fat to your recipe. It will just not be as stable.\nBut answering all your questions is ltrly impossible on reddit. These are questions I discuss with students over a time of at least three semesters. It really is a huuuuuge and complex field.\nBtw: that something was \"taken away\" does not generally mean, that it can be added later on again.

I\u2019m hoping to receive some career transition advice here.\nI graduated in 2020 with my Master\u2019s degree in Food Science. However, due to some personal circumstances and health issues, I\u2019ve been out of the workforce for 5 years now. Because of my circumstances, I\u2019ve been forced to make a career change into roles that are less physically demanding.\nI don\u2019t have industrial experience apart from my in-service training a decade ago. However, during my time in academia when I pursued postgraduate studies, I\u2019ve planned and conducted research and took a liking towards data analysis. Therefore, I\u2019m considering a career change into either Data Science or Analytics.\nEven though it has been extremely difficult to find a job given my circumstances, I haven\u2019t been idling. I\u2019ve been recovering, constantly working on myself and taking courses in data science and analytics.\nI\u2019m currently applying for jobs but I\u2019m also trying to build a project portfolio that I can use when applying for jobs in these roles. In a job market that\u2019s so highly competitive and one that mainly favours Computer Science, IT, Engineering, Maths and Stats graduates, how can I break into this field? Food Science is also quite a quantitative field. Statistics and Research Methodology is part of our coursework and is fundamental for those pursuing postgraduate studies in the field.\nWhilst I\u2019m still on my learning journey in data science and analytics (specifically SQL & Python), I\u2019m curious to hear from people who work in the food and beverage manufacturing industry. Thus far, I\u2019d rate myself as having intermediate level skills in Excel and Power BI and beginner to intermediate level skills in SQL. I\u2019m currently studying Python and machine learning at the moment.\nWhether you\u2019re a fellow food scientist, or working in sales, marketing, consumer insights, or even HR/Talent Recruiters looking for candidates in the food and beverage industry to fill data-related roles, I\u2019d like to know:\n1.\nHow do you use data in your role?\n(what business questions/problems do you solve with data?)\n2.\nHow is AI shaping the industry?\n(How is it used in your role or in the industry in general?)\n3.\nWhat kind of portfolio projects would stand out to you as a hiring manager or a recruiter in this industry?\n4.\nWhat tools/languages are commonly used in these industry for data analysis/analytics?\nThank you for taking the time to read my post.

Consider volunteering for citizen data science projects to put on your resume that you know how to collaborate on a project.\nI was a food scientist for a long time and am now a data analyst. But that was after a decade+ of work experience.\nNot a lot of my food science experience carried over to data except for my love of solving puzzles. My soft skills that I gained after a decade of working is more valuable than my python and SQL skills. Anyone can learn those skills on the fly but not everyone can communicate with others and stay organized to get a project done by a deadline.\nWhat you\u2019re trying to achieve is not impossible but is hard mostly due to your lack of work experience. People teaching themselves data science are a dime a dozen now especially because a lot of people use AI to code. If everyone\u2019s using AI to code, what makes you stand out? That\u2019s what you need to figure out.\nI have a remote forever data job but those are very hard to come by these days especially if it would be your first job. Also, the competition for entry level data science jobs is insane which is why I settled for an analyst job instead of a data scientist job. Though, I\u2019m currently transitioning into more technical data science work after 2 years as an analyst\u2014 mostly some ETL stuff and tuning models built by a senior data scientist. As an old lady who has changed careers later in life I am not afraid to play the long game so long as my job checks the boxes I want.\nBest of luck to you.

Has anyone had a similar experience and made the switch to sales and care to share their experience? Not that pay is the most important thing but it seems unless you are very senior level sales also pays much more than working as a technician or technologist.

Your social battery will be drained daily & you need to be comfortable delivering bad news/having uncomfortable conversations.

I\u2019ve been in the industry for a decade & definitely prioritize other perks over pay, so that may be why.

And when it comes to the actual chemistry, biology, and probability of these actually being 'invented/discovered', what is the most realistic / not science fiction?\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nClean-Label Shelf Life\nThe problem:\nBread, snacks, spreads, and dairy alternatives all rely on artificial preservatives or compromise freshness.\nUnmet need:\nNatural, label-friendly ways to inhibit mold, rancidity, and staling.\nOpportunity:\n\u201cFood-safe peptides\u201d or bio-fermented natural preservatives that extend shelf life 2\u20133\u00d7.\nWhy it matters:\nCuts waste (40% of food wasted globally is due to spoilage).\n2. Fat & Creaminess Without Palm Oil or Dairy\nThe problem:\nPalm oil = deforestation; dairy fat = climate impact + lactose issues.\nUnmet need:\nSustainable, affordable,\nscalable\nfat systems with the same melting/crystallization curves as butter, cheese, or chocolate.\nOpportunity:\nStructured lipids (enzymatic interesterification, precision fermentation, or novel emulsions).\nWhy it matters:\nEvery bakery, confection, and plant-based product needs this.\n3. Sugar Reduction That Doesn\u2019t Taste Fake\nThe problem:\nStevia, monk fruit, allulose, erythritol = aftertaste, gut effects, regulatory drama.\nUnmet need:\nNatural, metabolic-friendly sweetness that tastes like sugar and performs like sugar in baking.\nOpportunity:\nEnzymatically modified sugars, flavor modulators from fermentation, or novel \u201csweet enhancers.\u201d\nWhy it matters:\nSugar is public enemy #1 in health policy. Whoever solves this wins.\n4. Protein Functionality, Not Just Quantity\nThe problem:\nPlant proteins exist, but they don\u2019t foam, gel, bind, or taste like eggs, casein, or whey.\nUnmet need:\nDrop-in replacements that actually work in baking, whipping, emulsifying, and melt/stretch applications.\nOpportunity:\nDirected enzyme/protein engineering for functional properties.\nWhy it matters:\nUnlocks real plant-based cheese, baked goods, confectionery, and beverages.\n5. Satiety & Blood Sugar Control\nThe problem:\nMost snacks spike glucose, drive overconsumption, and fail to satisfy.\nUnmet need:\nEveryday foods (snacks, breads, cereals) that naturally blunt glucose and increase satiety.\nOpportunity:\nResistant starches, novel fibers, peptides that trigger GLP-1, or food structures that slow digestion.\nWhy it matters:\nObesity + diabetes epidemic \u2192 trillion-dollar problem.\n6. Natural Color & Flavor Stability\nThe problem:\nBeet juice turns brown; turmeric fades; fruit preps brown or lose aroma.\nUnmet need:\nNatural stabilizers that lock in bright color + fresh flavor without synthetics.\nOpportunity:\nEncapsulation, antioxidants, enzymatic blockers.\nWhy it matters:\n\u201cNo artificial colors/flavors\u201d is now table stakes, but current natural solutions underperform.\n7. Allergen Reduction\nThe problem:\nPeanuts, gluten, dairy, soy are nutritious but allergenic.\nUnmet need:\nSafe versions that keep taste and function but reduce allergenic epitopes.\nOpportunity:\nEnzymatic or thermal\u2013enzymatic treatment guided by proteomics.\nWhy it matters:\nUnlocks school cafeterias, institutional buyers, and massive consumer trust.\n8. Food Safety Without Chemicals\nThe problem:\nPackaged foods rely on propionates, sorbates, and chlorine washes.\nUnmet need:\nNaturally antimicrobial surfaces, bio-derived sprays, or barrier films.\nOpportunity:\nEdible protective coatings (protein/polysaccharide hybrids, essential oil nanoparticles).\nWhy it matters:\nRetailers and regulators are pushing \u201cclean label\u201d + reduced foodborne illness risk.\n9. Protein Taste Masking (Plant-Based Bitterness)\nThe problem:\nPea protein = beany, bitter, chalky. Soy = earthy.\nUnmet need:\nNatural processes to neutralize off-flavors without masking sugar/salt.\nOpportunity:\nFermentation-derived enzymes, fractionation, or microencapsulation.\nWhy it matters:\nEvery plant-based brand is trying to solve this\u2014unsuccessfully.\n10. Next-Gen Digestive Health Beyond Probiotics\nThe problem:\nProbiotics alone are a weak solution; most die before the gut.\nUnmet need:\nFoods that actively reshape the microbiome with precision.\nOpportunity:\nDesigner fibers, prebiotic cocktails, or postbiotic bioactives.\nWhy it matters:\nGut health = mental health, immunity, metabolic health.",

But 3 months in the fridge -- and they are mushy and basically inedible.

        "top_comment": "1T salt (assuming 17g, but this could vary wildly depending on what type of salt you're using - can you confirm? fine sea salt, coarse, brand, whatever) to 1 qt water = 1.8% salt, which, IMO, is on the low end of what I've seen commercially and in recipes for home use.\nCommercially, it's common to see some crazy high-salt brines (like 6%!), then, post-fermentation, that brine is drained off, the pickles often get a rinse, and a more palatable ~2% brine is added to the final packaging. With their huge batch sizes, salt = insurance. I can't speak for newer/more \"crafted\" brands here, but this method was at least common with the Big Guys when I was in a pickle lab a ~decade ago. But this is obviously atypical at home. Just pointing out that low salt\ncan\nlead to spoilage more readily.\nBoiling brine will kill most microbes in your brine, but there's plenty of stuff alive in the cucumbers - think, that's what started the fermentation in the first place!\nIf fermenting at room temp, you'd typically be looking for around 3-4 weeks at warmer room temps, 5-6 weeks at cooler ones. Your 7-10 day range may not be reducing pH enough and is instead letting spoilage microorganisms out-compete your desirable ones.\nSee this\nNCHFP tested recipe\nfor reference. It uses\n2T\nsalt per quart water,\nplus\na bit of vinegar at the start, fermented for 3-6 weeks depending on temperature. While you\ncan\nferment for less time if you're storing in the fridge, since it doesn't need to reach a safe pH for canning, your combo of short fermentation, low salt, and no starting vinegar has you in a higher-risk (for spoilage - not, like, death) situation.\nDouble checking: you slice off the blossom end, right?\nIf spoilage is causing issues, calcium chloride won't solve your problems, but it\ndoes\ndo a decent job of keeping un-spoiled pickles crisp over a longer shelf life."

        "body": "Hello! Like my title says I am struggling to keep up with my prep classes for the food science major.\nI had a long journey of trying to choose a major and switched many times before landing on food science. I graduated high school in 2020 and went to community college right after initially I was in marketing but wasn\u2019t doing good in economics so I changed to education since I was working at a school and had a \u2018I\u2019ll just do this\u2019 attitude and needed to decide on a major. Found out I didn\u2019t like that and after getting my associates I didn\u2019t transfer.\nI found out about food science around my third year of cc from a show I was watching. I was very intrigued and surprised that it was an option. I have always loved food and the process that went into preparing it, not only cooking but things like brewing, fermentation, and growing. I watched so many \u2018how it\u2019s made\u2019 videos when I was younger too lol.\nI never considered a STEM career out of high school bc bluntly I did not have the best grades in math and I did not do well. I felt like I was too dumb to even consider it or do research into the STEM careers. I also had never taken chemistry because I went to a rural high school where they only offered Ag science classes which honestly no one really learned since FFA was their main thing.\nSo after going back and forth and deciding I didn\u2019t want to teach just yet I decided to switch to food science. Talked to my advisor we made a plan and it went okay the first two semesters. I was on track to do gen chem 2 and social/life science calc.\nWhen it was time for those classes my chem prof was switched to a different one who was notoriously known to be terrible and then my calc prof took a leave of absence so both of the classes I had scheduled were ruined for me. Gen chem prof was terrible and withdrew while in calc the dean decided to put two prof in charge of the 16 week course and split into two which ended horribly and a lot of people withdrew.\nIn the end I completed no classes in fall 24. Now spring 25 I took chem again and this time regular calc 1 since they didn\u2019t have many prof in the other one. I passed chem but withdrew from calc 1 since I was struggling with many factors outside of class.\nSo now I\u2019m taking calc 1 again fall 25 and a day before semester began I got an email from the dean who stated our calc prof will no longer teach the class and we have another prof taking over the class. It was the same prof who took care of my calc class in fall 24.\nI was frustrated because I already know how he taught and I told the dean of the math dept that in past experience the sub had not had the canvas up until the end of the semester so I told him to try to check in on the class to avoid this or with me at least.\nThe dean said they would check in about second/third week but he did not until I reached out to him again by the end of the fourth and really told him how he had not been truthful to his words.\nSo now the canvas is up on the fifth week the prof had only send to email for our hw and practice sheets. So I\u2019m struggling all over again. I keep failing calc and it has set me so far back that I don\u2019t even have motivation to continue this major especially since there are no transferable food science classes offered at my college.\nI feel again too stupid for this degree even though I really thought I found the major that resonated the most with me. When I learn about food science I get excited, it feeds my curiosity and I want to continue but this calc class has set me back so much and I still have to take organic chem. My confidence has taken a bad hit and I feel too stupid for that too.\nI\u2019m guessing this really might not be the major for me but the thought of changing it makes me feel even worse. I\u2019m 23 so I\u2019ve been in cc for awhile and I should already have a bachelors but I don\u2019t.\nEveryone is moving on and I can\u2019t even get a degree. I\u2019m thinking of dropping out completely but I know I\u2019ll regret that too.",
        "top_comment": "Sorry you're dealing with this, and it sounds like you're trying to advocate for yourself as much as you can.\nKnow that, while a FS bachelor's typically requires calc 1/2 (and some only require 1), most to all of the FS-specific courses are algebra-based, e.g. my food engineering class was algebra-based. If calc isn't your thing, that's okay. Plenty of jobs in the industry never use it. So long as you have decent algebra skills, you're fine.\nOn the other hand, if organic chem really kicks your butt, that\ncould\nbe a sign that the field may not be up your alley. It's a chem-heavy degree. You don't need to be phenomenal at organic, but you do need a decent handle of it.\nOn the third hand (I guess I'm an alien now), I had a shitshow of a semester in undergrad where my options were to do a retroactive withdrawal, which would set my graduation back a year because of my program's course sequence having a long chain of prereqs, or to take like four Fs and an incomplete in that prereq course, and finish up its two tests I'd missed in the fall. I did the latter. Graduated on time, GPA was kind of trash, still got a good job fresh out of school, doing great a decade later. By no means is that guaranteed, but the food industry is one where the degree gets you in the door, but after that, industry experience is supreme.\nBig classes (and some CC classes) can make you feel like you're drowning alone if you're struggling. At least know that a perk of FS programs, even at huge schools, is that your department tends to be pretty small. The professors know you by name, advisors should be a bit more hands-on if you want it, etc. My massive biochem lecture kicked my butt, but I loved my FS classes with <40 people in them.\nDon't beat yourself up on the timing. My FS program had a decent number of people in their late 20s and early 30s transitioning from other careers (mostly culinary, plus a few very random ones like retail store management). Faculty often love the students who aren't <21 years old. You're more mature and more likely to be there as an \"adult\" decision, not one your parents pushed you into.\nAlso, something I bring up a lot with the STEM-y volunteering I do with students: people\nlove\nto mentally gatekeep STEM fields as places where only the most brilliant people are allowed to be. That's BS. One, academic skills will only get you so far, and two, the world is made up of mostly everyday people like you and me. Just like you don't need to be your country's foremost essayist to be, say, a successful ad copywriter, you don't need to cure cancer to be a scientist.\nedit: also, have you tried any of your CC's resources related to tutoring? They should have decent ones for those common courses like calc or organic."

Add to that the fact that many flavors are using a dozen plus compounds, and you're potentially looking at hundreds to thousands of dollars to \"construct\" one formula (plus the fact that, if you're not a flavorist, you probably won't make something you like very much when just starting out). Remember to keep relevant safe usage limits for each compound in mind, plus appropriate ventilation and PPE when working with them.\nBasically, if you're an individual looking to flavor something for yourself or a smaller market, I'd recommend going to a small-scale supplier like Bull City and just buying premade flavors.

I've been doing it a few days already and with no hitch but one time i was testing viscosity on several samples but the spindle kept loosening up on the joint screw. So i screwed the spindle really hard because it was causing delays in our production. It worked perfectly fine but once i finished i cannot remove the spindle properly so i tried unscrewing it several times until someone helped me unscrew it with pliers.\nNow, i'm trying to use it now for new products and the spindle isn't spinning properly. I noticed that each spin has a sound and does not read any milipascal second, rotational speed, or even temperature. I don't know what to do, i think i screwed up the sensor as well as the spinning mechanism of our viscometer.",

It probably won\u2019t be a scientifically solid recipe but you\u2019ll learn a few things while making it. How does it mix together? If it\u2019s too sweet what happens if you reduce the syrup content? \u00a0what happens when those bars are stored in the fridge, out on the counter, in the freezer, etc?. these are very simple experiments you can do at home to get a sense if product development is for you or not."

I\u2019d like to be more hands on with lowering added sugar and developing additional flavors. For anyone who has worked in frozen desserts, how does bringing in a consultant usually fit into the process when you already have a co packer with R&D? Do they collaborate with the co packer or do they typically run trials separately?",
        "top_comment": "It depends on how the co-packer likes to operate and what you're seeking from the consultant. Most co-packers don't love others bringing on consultants as then they have to share confidential data and practices with a third-party. So you could have a consultant run separate trials and try to scale those with the co-packer, but that's a fairly fruitless endeavor if the two of them don't talk to each other.\nThe consultant will need to know how the co-packer runs their operations, and again, usually they aren't going to share as that's all fairly confidential. Because ultimately it doesn't matter what you have in your hands at a prototypical stage. If you don't know how to scale it with fidelity, it's quite useless.\nSometimes as a consultant, I'll oversee what the co-packer does on-site, especially if there are edge case scenarios where they fairly routinely run into technical challenges with flow, viscosity, heating, stuck fermentation, etc. But that also depends on the type of consultant you bring on, and it's also very expensive to do so you better know exactly what you want out of that service. Some are more skilled at microbiology, others are skilled in flavors, and still others have better experience with materials and rheology.\nSo it all depends on the scope of what you want the consultant to do. At this stage, it probably doesn't make that much sense to be doing separate prototyping unless you're fairly confident that someone like me would be able to talk to the co-packer and have a good working relationship. I can develop a formulation, but again, there's only so much I can do to translate that into a full-scale operation without understanding the technical guts of the operation itself (equipment, volume, flow speed, processing, etc.)\nI suppose what prevents you from just having the co-packer do it? What exactly is it that you want out the relationship with the consultant? Do you want to own the recipe? Just getting clear on your exact goals will save money and improve expectations between you and the service provider, because a good one is not cheap."

So while you achieve a safe temp, you expose the outside to potentially lower heat.\nWhen I cook meatballs in a pan, they tend to brown as hamburgers do.\nI've also thought perhaps there's a bit of curing going on, or interaction with other ingredients usually in a meatball vs. a burger, but I ain't smart enough fer that thinking."

Feeling a little disheartened to say, but I don't think I want to do this for the rest of my life and I think I want a career change into something entirely different. I thought this was my dream job, and there are aspects of my job that I enjoy, but I'm simply not enjoying R&D as a whole anymore.\nBackground:\nI have my BS and MS in Food Science, and worked in food safety/QA prior to R&D. I did not enjoy QA at all, but I appreciated the knowledge and experience that it gave me and I believe helped me develop into my R&D career.\nWhat I love about R&D:\nI love opportunities to be creative and work with a brand.\nI enjoy the consumer side of innovation and product development 'and love working with the consumer insights/marketing team.\nIt's extremely rewarding to see a product that you worked on, out in market.\nWhat I don't love (being blunt):\nI don't enjoy the manufacturing side of it. I honestly hate traveling for plant trials and the long hours. I have a very busy life outside of work and traveling is very hard on my schedule and lifestyle. I left manufacturing when I worked in food safety/QA, and left for many reasons. Working with manufacturing is a large part of R&D and I really want nothing to do with manufacturing plants.\nI feel like R&D is somewhat thankless. We wear so many hats: food safety, finance/costing, business/branding, packaging. As much as we do, we don't get paid that great (at least what I've seen across some companies).\nI used to love benchtop work, but not anymore. I don't see myself working in a lab long-term.\nEven though I've been in this field for a few years, I don't feel like I have a STEM brain...at the end of the day, I don't think this field is a good \"fit\" for me. I can do the work and I'm good at my job, but I feel like I have to \"work\" so much harder than peers to understand material, data, and make decisions. The type of thinking required to do this job, does not come naturally to me.\nI don't want to be a \"technical expert\", I don't want to feel like I have to constantly be \"the smartest person in the room\".

The fuzzy part is what you\ndo\nwant--\u201cmarketing/ branding/ consumer insights\u201d are career umbrellas, and some parts might feel just as draining if you don\u2019t narrow it to specific activities.\nTake some time to ask yourself: when you felt most alive at work (or even outside it)? Pitching ideas? Storytelling? Talking with consumers? Leading a brainstorm? Coaching others? Those moments point to the skills that will actually bring you joy.\nMBA = useful if you\u2019re aiming at Fortune 100 brand management. Otherwise, before burning years on an MBA, run small experiments onyourself--\n- Treat it like an R&D test: volunteer for a cross-functional launch, sit in on a marketing brainstorm.\n- Track what energizes you vs. what feels like slog. Talk to peers in those fields: what\u2019s their week really like? What\u2019s fun? draining?\n- Map your energy highs: note experiences that felt exciting even when hard. That\u2019s better data than job titles. Look for places where the challenge of building mastery its own reward.\nOnce you know what lights you up, you\u2019ll know whether school, networking, or targeted upskilling is the right lever.\nGood Luck!"

But their gelation temperature is also dependant on salt concentration. And on concentration of other ions such as K+ and Ca2+. And some types interact with certain proteins. And if the Ph is too low it will not gell properly at all. And how do we define 'gelation temperature' in the first place, and does everyone measure this in the same way?\nNow suddenly there's no single 'gelation temperature of carrageenan', not even a list, but there's a matrix with at least 5 different variables and a certain defined measurement method.

Cooked to ~175F and then pureed with the stock.\nMy question is the presence of stock/water in the emulsified product and cooling and eating cold. I\u2019ve cooked the raw product well past the temperature to kill harmful bacteria. Is there any scientific risk with the amount of stock/water (approximately 30%) in the meat after it has been cooled under proper conditions being eaten sliced and cold? I\u2019ve braised meats and stored them in the braising liquid before, but those items were typically reheated in a restaurant setting. Not served cold.\nThank you in advance!",
        "top_comment": "The reason pregnant women should avoid deli meat has nothing to do with how the product is cooked. It is because Listeria mono can grow at refrigeration, and it is impossible to be 100% sure that you have prevented L. Mono recontamination if you handle the product at all after it is cooked. Cooling the bologna and then slicing it and holding it at refrigeration is where the hazard comes from."

I would like to apply to University of Massachusetts Amherst, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, UC Davis, and University of Maryland. I\u2019d like to know if these are good and realistic choices. Any tips for applying to grad school and stuff are also very welcome! Thank you _^",
        "top_comment": "GPA means nothing as long as you're above 3.0 from my experience. What you need to look for when applying for grad school is the research topic and opportunity you're interested in. You can do this by looking up the faculties at the schools you are interested in and reading their research papers. You'd then have to contact the faculty members and ask them about any potential opportunities to research with their lab after applying to the school. Sometimes the specific faculty member you want might not have any open opportunities.\nWhen I was applying, I'd contact multiple faculty members from some schools, or just 1 if there's really only one field I'm interested in there.\nAs a sidenote, based on my experience, companies care more about industry experience, especially for product development. If that's what you're most interested in, I suggest applying to new job positions instead.\nGood luck."

That\u2019s why co-mans are wary of small, variable runs\u2014onboarding a startup takes way more effort than working with an established brand.\nBoth sides have burned each other before, so trust is thin. And if a brand finds a great partner, they tend to keep it quiet\u2014it\u2019s a competitive edge.\nYour idea has real potential.

        "top_comment": "Id say it depends.\nIf you want to stay in QA for the time being id focus on trying to get into compliance side - especially around specification roles. From there id make sure youre involved with new product development roles that focus on scale. Jobs in the pilot plant for example.\nFrom there your biggest obstacle is more getting into an adjacent industry however in my experience from a RD/PD side, meat science, dairy science, beverage and produce are kinda treated as a separate entity vs snacks or confectionery  because the products are vastly different. QA is a benefit here in that its easier to be a QA professional to switch between industries. So that can help although youre still in QA. But generally speaking, if you can prove youre good at bringing products to scale most companies will give you a shot as thats always a need from an RD side. But its technically a different skill set (much more about Product Management) than a pure food science Research and Development. However, it will give you better opportunities for advancement vs just staying in a pure product development role. Those are generally more limited in number.\nGood luck!"

All explanations I can find say that more hygroscopic sugars make cookies more chewy, but I wouldn't necessarily say softer=more chewy. Are they correct? Does a more moist/softer cookie correlate with its chewiness?\n(When I say chewy I don't mean gum chewy, I mean like a rice krispy treat with lots of marshmallow)\nEdit: I hope this isn't a silly question lol",
        "top_comment": "I\u2019m pretty sure this is because water is interrupting or partially dissolving the crystal lattice of sugar and starch.\nSugar crystals are repeating patterns of arrangements of sugar molecules. When water interacts with these crystals it surrounds a molecule of sugar and lets it break free from the solid structure.\nImagine pushing down on a jenga tower. If you make the tower hollow in parts rather than a solid chunk, it\u2019s easier to knock over.\nIn the same way, the crystal lattice becomes easier to deform when you introduce weak spots. And those weak spots appear when water takes the sugar crystals out of the lattice.\nStarch also forms crystals, so this may be true for starch too."

Your opportunities will depend on where you live in the country and your ability to move.\n1) start off in the meat industry\n2) move up from QA tech to HACCP coordinator as soon as you can and learn about export market requirements\n3) If you want to move to product development / R&D this is the step to do it at imo because you will have a backup job you can take to continue gaining exp if something fails. Big grocery chains are your best bet imo.\n4) have fun and work hard. Your best asset after your technical knowledge is english communication with people from different backgrounds. Make sure you can understand them and they can understand you. Go to networking events where you can and make your company get your certs"

It is so different making a bench top sample, and scaling to a machine making over 50,000 gummies at a time. Jacob was super easy to work with and he even connected me with manufacturers who can make small pour and scrape sybas to larger machine run batches.

Research wise, I take interest in probiotic foods (anything fermented) and their impact on our body/health, yeast cultures and how to improve yeast production, and pretty much anything related to baking/bread production. However, I am pretty open to anything if it means getting a job lol\nI'm looking for advice on what I should do during my next few years in undergrad to help prepare me for the industry. I'm already looking at getting a job in food service to help build experience, and I plan on trying to find some kind of research to do at my school. However, my university doesn't have a food science degree plan (closest thing is the minor in nutrition and food sciences) so my options for food science specific research are somewhat limited. I would transfer to a university that does offer the degree, however financially I don't think it is possible.\nI currently have my ServSafe Food Managers Certification, and a lapsed Food Safety Certification that I'm planning on reupping soon.\nI have seen some things about a HAACP and PCQI certifications that could be beneficial, should I do those now to try and get a leg up?\nAnd in terms of networking, how would I go about that? Again, my university doesn't have a food science program, and there aren't many options club-wise. The two clubs I'm looking into are a Student Nutrition Association and my university's Texas Restaurant Association chapter.

We are much smaller but with current membership composed of over 65% individuals who consider themselves \"research chefs\" or \"culinologists\" there is a very strong unity of identity within the organization.\nI'm not a food scientist, just a restaurant bum who wanted to be around people who get excited discussing food ... But also didn't want to work nights and weekends anymore, and the RCA has always felt like a home for people who found their way to the industry like that.\nThat being said, your question is related to dollar value, not necessarily esoteric\nvibes\n.  For food scientists, that true value might not be there... Yet.  We try to bring in engaging speakers and events that apply to not only the chef crowd but also the food science crowd.\nI'll be curious to see how others respond and hope it gets good engagement.  The RCA is celebrating 30 years of existence at our conference in Denver next March.  If anyone is curious, conference is the place to find out.  The energy there is unlike any industry I've been to, despite being tiny in comparison.\nI'll add further, without knowing exactly the membership growth of IFT or ACF, anecdotally I've heard it's not trending up.  RCA, since covid, has grown membership, conference attendance, and conference exhibitors. We're currently updating our textbook and Culinary Scientist / Research Chef certifications.  We have a new management company, with greater transparency and accountability for funds, and are building our long term plans for delivering value to members and growing the organization. We've put chairs to oversee three new regional hubs, brought back scholarships and our cooking competition ... With lots more planned.\nTl;dr - I'm very biased, sitting on the board of directors, but love the RCA and find it valuable.  It's a small but hyper community focused org. with our ears open to how we can do better and mean more for our members."

The thing that makes caramel caramel - aka the brown color and the bitter taste - arent carbs or sugar\nMy friend is saying the thing that makes caramel caramel arent carbs. From a chemical perspective, caramelized sugar does not contain carbs cuz a chemist looks at an ideal solution, whereas from a nutritional perspective, caramelized sugar does contain carbs cuz a nutritionist looks at an actual solution. However, to me still at the end of the day carmelized sugar ( the brown color and bitter taste) still has sugar and carbs for to me if given to a person or diabetic it would still spike your insulin levels.\nSo conclusion the argument is.. is \u201c ideal caramelized sugar\" - the thing that makes caramel caramel - does or does it not contain carbs. If it does or does not.. how? From a chemists standpoint.\nThen my friend said this:\nMy argument yesterday is that \"ideal caramelized sugar\" (say, ICS) - the thing that makes caramel caramel - does not contain carbs. I still stand by that. The reason is that ICS has those derivatives and the products following that but not sucrose, fructose, and glucose. Now, is it possible to create ICS?\nI\u2019m personally just confused bc to me carmelized sugar does have carbs because it isn\u2019t charred so it still contains carbs and sugar.

        "top_comment": "You can get meat incredibly tacky without any water binders. Salt solubilizes meat proteins, so the native protein structures kind of relax and unwind. When you cook meat that's has its protein extracted, most of the solubilized ends of protein strands will form crosslinks with the ends of protein it's in contact with, resulting in a fairly strong bond.\nMix your meat with 1.5-2.0% salt by weight (this is a fair amount and can be cut back depending on taste, but less salt is less effective extraction). Keep it cold the entire time. Pull vacuum if you can while mixing (special equipment necessary; unsure what you have access to).\nMix until you notice a little bit of protein residue sticking to the walls of your mixing vessel. This is a sure sign that you've extracted what you need and should have enough tack for a puck of this meat to stay more-or-less in one piece as its cooked.\nYou should be able to maintain shape well enough if you extract enough protein. Binders will help with firmness-- meat alone might be a little too soft depending on what you're using. They also help with consistency and sliceability."

I make soymilk for myself and friends, hoping to scale up and get into a commercial kitchen to get into farmers markets (to see how much demand there is for asian-style soymilk, experiment with dofuhua before I continue on the path to manufacturing) but struggling with undertanding how to increase shelf-life of the soymilk i'm making and what equipment it means I need to get.\nRight now I can make about 20 liters at home in a huge stockpot- soak dry beans overnight, blend with some water (100g of soaked beans with 1 liter of water), boil for 20 minutes, ladle into glass jars and get em into the fridge. It only lasts (by last I mean taste good) for about 3 maybe 4 days. That feels short and I want to increase the shelf life.\nSo, questions...\n- is there anything I can add to increase the shelf life of the soymilk if my process is going to look ^somewhat similar to the above for a while? Do I need to look into pasteurizing? Does pasteurizing even matter if I'm boiling the soymilk?\n- I've been looking at homebrew supply stores for equipment, but any recommendations for equipment I can get to speed up the boiling process? Currently takes like an hour and a half to 2 hours to come to a boil on a stove.\nMore longterm question...\n- how come there isn't shelf-stable soymilk that tastes asian-style (i.e. not milk-like, still has beany taste)? Is it just due to demand in the states? I just tried Fu Hang brand shelf stable soymilk from Costco (it's a very popular soymilk/breakfast spot in Taiwan), but it tastes like vitasoy and like it's been vanilla-fied and I was hoping for something more asian-style.\nThanks in advance for helping a newbie out, even pointing me in the right direction would be great.",
        "top_comment": "You\u2019re wanting to look into pasteurization. You\u2019re unlikely to find anything to improve your at-home process. A commercial kitchen will have stronger burners & maybe a kettle, which will speed up your heating.\nUnfortunately, high pH beverages (like milks) are the more difficult beverage to produce farmers market style. They really require specialized equipment (retort, UHT, HTST) to process correctly & improve shelf life. You\u2019ll likely find it difficult to properly heat & cool to pasteurization standards in anything but a co-manufacturing facility"

The result was that the outside dried too quickly and became brittle, while the inside stayed wet. Interestingly, when I sealed the noodles in a pack, the brittle parts softened again after about 12 hours.\nI\u2019ve read that many producers hang the noodles, twist them, and then pack them. I also tried hanging mine, but they just became too brittle.\nDoes anyone have insight on how to make semi-dry noodles that stay pliable enough for nesting or twisting during packaging?",
        "top_comment": "Hi I own an artisan pasta company. Without commercial drying equipment you cannot achieve your goal, I know it seems like Nonna did it in her kitchen but Nonna hung her noddles. Air drying noodles requires controlling the humidity, heat and air flow. Commercial makers put them in a pre dryer, then dry them. These pasta lines cost $$$$. So those artisan pasta you see from Italy are made by huge companies. No Nonnas involved \ud83d\ude42"

Is it pay better with a doctorate?\nI understand that my view about the food industry is somewhat through rose color glasses looking from outside (I dont know much about food R&D and is starting my research into it as of right now).

Great employees with internal referrals are still up against 20 other great people with internal referrals, as the total number of jobs available is so much smaller than it was five years ago.\nFive years ago, the VC money fire hose was still going strong, startups were popping up all over the place, and low interest rates had big pharma companies more open to the inherent financial risk of R&D work and clinical trials. Now, rates are higher, a lot of gov-sponsored research projects have been killed, and regulatory\u2026 oddities\u2026 have companies much less willing to invest millions in a technology that may be banned by a random executive order.\nIf you want to do bench work, also know that biotech is much heavier on PhDs than the food industry.\nI know that all sounds pessimistic, but to be honest, that\u2019s the reality of the industry right now.

And so now I turn to y'all. Is there a proper way you're supposed to go about formulation or is it really just tweaking recipes you found online or whatever? Are there any books y'all recommended to learn of said way? I wanted to ask my professors but from what I've seen of the course so far, what I'm asking specifically isn't in the curriculum.",
        "top_comment": "You're doing great by experimenting at home creating your own recipes. There isn't really one proper way to go about formulating. It really depends on the product/project you're working on and the company you work for. For example, say you work for a cookie dough manufacturing facility. A potential customer (like a grocery store chain) might tell your company \"I want chocolate chip cookie dough pre-portioned to 1.5 oz, I want it to cost us $X.XX/lb, use this specific type of chocolate, and make sure it has a 7 day shelf life after baking when packaged in bags with a clean ingredient list\". Part of that task might be researching ways to get 7 days shelf life, then doing some bench work.\nYou'll keep track of each iteration you work on -- always keep a record of what you're doing. Some companies have an ERP system for tracking formulations, others (like my current) more or less uses Excel shared into a common drive.\nYou'll see what works, see what doesn't, go back to researching new ingredients/mixing techniques/etc. etc. if needed until you land upon a formulation you think is successful. All the while, you'll also be thinking about the production equipment your facility has and making sure it is feasible on the line (for example, you might have a great cookie formulation but if the dough is really sticky, it might never succeed in production).  And depending on the product you're working with, you'll have different aspects/dimensions/measurements you'll use to create specifications to make sure the product can be produced and tested consistently down the road.\nSince you are still in school and don't work for a company yet, I would suggest thinking of a food problem or project that naturally fascinates you, and follow that. For example since you mentioned baking, maybe you're fascinated about how to create a vegan cake that is super fluffy just like angel food cake, and even though all the vegan forums say a vegan angel food cake is impossible, you chase after a solution. You can go down a lot of fun rabbit holes with a project like that. Keep a record of what you do - include ingredients, percentages, pictures, whatever you think you will need when referring back to it in the future.\nYou'll be surprised what kind of ingredients you can find at places like Amazon. Kitchen Alchemy is a great brand for food science-y ingredients you can purchase for home use. Even if you don't reach a solution, you'll have learned a lot about the process, ingredients, and product along the way.\nA project like that would be great to talk to a potential employer about as well. It shows that you are thinking about product development and have a passion and curiosity for it. Once you're hired by a company, you'll be looped into their specific formulation processes."

Have you checked with a doctor to make sure you don\u2019t have an underlying medical issue? I worked with people in marketing who didn\u2019t have a sense of smell so they just opted to never taste test products we made for them.\nMost people aren\u2019t born with the ability to describe nuanced flavors but expert tasters who have spent countless hours tasting and writing notes and \u201cgoing deep\u201d into identifying sensory descriptors have trained their palate and their brains to do this. But if you\u2019re struggling to even identify a berry flavor or other very characteristic notes I would seriously consider going to do the doctor and making sure there isn\u2019t something off.\nIf there\u2019s no medical issue I guess if I was you I would probably take time to home to literally start a journal of sensory notes and just takes notes of everything you consume for breakfast lunch dinner and snacks. Sounds painstaking but it\u2019ll help flex your sensory muscles. If you have cereal for breakfast, smell the bowl of cereal and take notes. When you are eating a piece of toast take note of the aromas before and after toasting.

If there\u2019s mineral oil and/or a lot of lecithin, even a small amount can feel quite greasy to the touch.\nIf you found it very noticeable, perhaps a nozzle became unclogged and went a bit overboard, or a human did the same. Can\u2019t hurt to contact them, though the customer service rep will likely need to contact another person with a question that specific. Decent chance they\u2019ll send you a coupon. :)\nedit: and on the stale oil note, it could be an old batch of pan release, or there\u2019s a nonzero chance the bakery does not wet-wash their pans frequently. In my experience (very large scale), pans were not washed frequently at all. The oil polymerizes and forms a nice nonstick coating, which makes production easier. Pans for, say, wheat bread, would stay with wheat bread and could only move to gluten free after a validated deep-cleaning step. If some half-polymerized oil got onto your bread, it could smell a bit rancid. No health hazard, just not a pleasant aroma."

But I recently purchased a jar of ghee*, and the label said \"For best results, store at room temperature\".\nI'm puzzled by this. What are the downsides to storing ghee in the fridge?  There are certainly some foods whose flavor degrades in the fridge (e.g., peaches and tomatoes), but ghee, like oils generally, shouldn't be among them.\nYes, you'll get more flavor from it when it's warm, but that's a non-issue, since I only use it for cooking, so it gets warmed up anyways.   The only other consideration I can think of is that warm ghee is easier to scoop out of the jar and spread, but that's not a problem for me.\n*4th & Heart Truffle Ghee.\nIngredients: Clarified butter, sea salt, dehydrated black summer truffle, black truffle concentrate.\nNote that their recommendation to store at room temperature has nothing to do with the truffles, since the label for their plain ghee (which contains clairified butter only) says the same.\nThey also sell ghee butter sticks, which they recommend be refrigerated, indicating that refrigeration shouldn't damage the flavor: \"While our ghee sticks are shelf stable from a food safety standpoint, we recommend refrigerating our ghee sticks to help them keep their shape and make them easier to work with.\"\nI'll email the manufacturer to ask their reasoning, but first wanted to hear what this sub had to say.\nMANUFACTURER'S REPLY\n(it's not for any of the reasons suggeted in the comments--it's to prevent mold):\n\"We recommend storing your\u00a0ghee\u00a0in a dark place, like a pantry or cupboard, away from light or heat sources to keep it from degrading. Keeping it in the fridge is an option, however, it's not typically recommended as you may experience condensation which could lead to mold\u00a0growth.\"\nAnd in a follow-up, they wrote:\n\"If condensation or high moisture in your fridge is a low or unlikely occurrence, then the risk of mold developing is also low. Because of these differences from refrigerator to refrigerator, we recommend\u00a0storing\u00a0ghee\u00a0in a cool, dark cupboard or pantry, away from light and heat sources. This method of storage is perfectly sufficient.\"\nAs to why the ghee sticks can be stored in the refrigerator:\n\"Our\u00a0ghee\u00a0stick wrappers actually utilize a special technology to protect the product while in the refrigerator.\"\n[I suspect it's also because, since they aren't sealed in a bottle, you don't have condensation.]",

If you're lucky they'll put up with that but you won't exactly be their favourite client. If you're unlucky then someone who looks at the money side will get fed up and you'll find you no longer have a packer.\nIf you're new to manufacturing environments then the tour will probably just feel like lots of (hopefully) shiny machinery and stainless steel. I'd be asking about things like their preferred batch sizing, lead time for booking production slots, ability to accommodate production trials and the batch sizes for those, what sort of food safety and quality certification they have, potentially whether they offer additional services (e.g. warehousing, logistics, artwork / label creation, recipe development etc) if they're potentially useful to you.\nIf they've made the fairly hefty investment in UHT then you'd hope the site and business are pretty good, but it doesn't hurt to be thorough rather than making assumptions.

A preservative (e.g. calcium propionate) won't do anything for texture. It just inhibits mold.\nAt home, a tangzhong can help slow staling, though I don't think of that as a typical sourdough component. It's mostly used for breads that are very soft.\nAt the end of the day, fresh crusty bread doesn't last long, and you just need to consume it quickly. Most commercial solutions for preventing staling work better on soft breads like a sandwich loaf, rather than crusty ones."

Understand that sometimes too, you want to call that out so consumers know what to expect (onion powder vs pieces of onions) etc...\nRegarding your question, it's common to list that garlic and onion as \"powder\" or \"dried\"...some kind of description that tells you it's not a fresh chunk of the food.  However it's also common to use an \"\n\" if you have a lot of those and say \"garlic\n, onion\n\" and at the end of your ingredient dec say *Powder (or dried or dehydrated organic... whatever all those ingredients are).  Chili Powder can often be a multi-component ingredient with cumin, salt, spices etc...watch out for that.

Primarily due to lack of proper systems in place and proper equipment needed. and i was essentially working from a deficit, and i have been placing an extraordinary amount of effort (extended hours in the lab) in order to place the company in a better position\nwithin my first 4 months i completely overhauled the lab, and brought it to a good standing where it upholds GMP/Food safety codes. Re organized for more space and created systems to track inventory and processes to uphold higher quality samples for clients. After that not only has my skillset been elevating quite rapidly,  Projects are consistently being approved within V1-V2, i am essentially filling the role that i \"was hired to do\" Which is being the director of this department.

However, we have a product called \"confittiere\" which are chunks of broken chocolate in 16 kg bags that we then portion as 1 kg bags to resell to final consumers, restaurants and bars (thing melts faster than chocolate bricks and stuff).\nI was chosen as team lead because execs get the whole flow diagram as part of it so process engineer = HACCP lead I guess.\nI have mapped out the process and understand where I should implement the basic PRPs but I'm wondering what even is the scope of a HACCP plan for warehouses, I get I should have CCPs for my portioning process, but I'm not sure if I should have them for anything else. Where do I draw the line for \"within scope of a HACCP plan\"? Since everything I look for is oriented to food manufacturing rather than storage by itself.\nAlso, is there some sort of list of typical PRPs? I have so far:\n- visual inspection on arrival (not sure if quality tests apply to my portioned chocolate item or not)\n- pest control on arrival and in site\n- cleaning and disinfection (hand washing, truck and general warehouse cleaning)\n- inventory rotation\n- temperature control\n- best practices for product handling and warehouse upkeep\n- glass and brittle material handling\nBut I'm not sure if I'm missing something else (pretty sure there should be allergen management thrown in there somewhere, but again, not sure how much HACCP requires of it within a warehouse.\nMy macro process is really simple, arrival to storage and then storage to delivery with these two subprocesses of repackaging within then storage to delivery macro.\nChocolate portioning is: open 16 kg box \u2192 fill bags\u2192 weight it for 1 kg + 0.1 kg tolerance \u2192 label with lot/expiry date \u2192 seal with tape \u2192 load to truck \u2192 ship\nRight now it is done manually in a table within the dry items area, but we may move it inside the cold storage area (18-22 \u00b0C).\nAny help would be appreciated.

Preventive Controls is its own whole thing, and you need to be trained in order to do the assessments and write the plan. That's something I'd encourage you to look into.\nEither way, allergen management should be its own PRP and also part of the cleaning and sanitation program. The allergen program should describe how you keep allergens segregated from non-allergens in your facility, and the cleaning and sanitation program should describe how you ensure that your processes adequately prevent allergen cross-contact.\nEdit: I see you're not in the US, so forget about the first paragraph unless you're exporting to the US"

Often that's what you focus on in grad school or develop through a career.\nWherever possible, get someone else to pay for your education. Large companies often have tuition reimbursement programs. Grad schools have funding you can get through scholarships. These are great opportunities to exploit.\nIf you want an easy way to learn the industry, sign up for equipment auction website newsletters and recall alerts from your government health agency. These will teach you what equipment is out there and what it costs. Seeing weekly recalls will give you an idea of the risks in food and the current events in industry.\nAnd three books I'd always recommend: On Food and Cooking, The Tetrapak Dairy Processing Handbook (free online), and Canned Foods by GMA"

Unfortunately this year the passion fruit harvest will not be big, so I can't really compare different methods side by side.  The issue I am looking at is flavor retention.  This sauce will be heat treated as it contains fresh ingredients along with fermented items.  I would like to retain as much of the tropical flavor as possible, but I know that heat can degrade it.  Is it the loss of volatiles that drive the flavor loss?  Or is it thermal degradation?  Or both?  My thought was to process the sauce without the passion fruit then mix the sauce and fruit in the bottle followed by a hot water bath.  At least that way the volatiles would be contained in the bottle.  But if thermal degradation is also happening, then maybe it would be useless.  The fruit could be included in a ferment, but then the volatiles could be lost due to off gassing.  Any thoughts/inputs?",

The original question:\nDoes cooking and refrigerating oatmeal create more resistant starches than just soaking them for overnight oats?\nObviously the answer to this specific question of \"creating\" resistant starch is \"yes\". Because soaking, as far as I know, doesn't make resistant starch.\nBUT. There are different types of resistant starch.  The one above is Type 3. According to some (shallow) research, oats are pretty high in Type 1, and by cooking the oats, you destroy (some of?) these and make them no longer resistant to being digested.\nSo,\nOvernight Oats > Fresh cooked Oats (Type1)\\\nCook/Refrigerated > Fresh cooked oats (Type 3)\nObviously both overnight and cooked and refrigerate oats have more resistant starch than fresh cooked.\nBut, is there a way to find out which way may result in more resistant starch?",
        "top_comment": "Type 1 resistant starch resists degrading at cooking temperatures, so more or less all the initial type 1 resistant starch should still be present in cooked and cooled oats. As overnight oats are only partially cooked during processing, the at home soaking and is probably not creating very much type 3 starch.\nI didnt find any comparison studies but based on this, likely cooked and cooled oats would have the most overall fibre.\nThat being said, I personally find it easier to eat a larger serving of less-bulky overnight oats than an equal serving of hot cooked (and cooled) oats due to the difference in volumes. Eating a larger serving of oats would probably outweigh the differences in preparation, but of course I am speculating.\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10987757/"

Given there are 12 grams of sugar and 30 grams carbohydrates on the nutrition facts, I assume that means 12 grams of fructose and 18 grams of maltodextrin.\nI am assuming that they are using low methoxyl pectin due to the presence of calcium lactate in the ingredients\nI've tried a lot of things, but mainly the process has been going like this:\nThoroughly mix all the dry ingredients except for the calcium lactate\nMaltodextrin 18 g\nFructose 12 g\nLM amidated pectin .5g\nCitric acid .2g\nAdd about 20g water and heat until everything is dissolved\nDissolve the calcium lactate (.2g) into a small amount of water\nMix the calcium solution into the water\nWhen I do this, the gel forms almost immediately and has a nice clear texture. But as I let it sit over the course of about 12 hours in the refrigerator, the mixture goes cloudy and becomes slightly gritty.\nI can't seem to figure out how to get the gel to be stable and smooth.

        "top_comment": "So I have some experience of this as both a co-packer and as someone that has sought the right co-packer on behalf of my clients.\nIn the packaging world there are lots of things that can be done by hand. There's big stuff that can be done semi-automatically on a small scale.  The automation of filling/packing/sealing came from something being done at home, then on a cottage industry scale, then larger and better machines.  Always improving, always getting faster, more efficient, more productive than the starting position which was 'by hand'.\nStick packs don't comply to that 'rule'.  They're not something that was ever done by hand.  They only exist because of industrialisation.  The industries that wanted them were already mature and wanted large amounts.  The machines are designed to make something small, something inexpensive, something which can be given away free oftentimes.  That means they need scale. Lots and LOTS and LOTS to make it even worth the effort of turning the machine on.  The equipment is expensive, it's working at tiny scales and it has to be very very precise.\nAll of this is to say that yeah, it's going to be a pain in the butt, but for a good reason.\nSo, how do you get around this?\nSo there are places that do smaller scale, but you may have to go outside of your country to achieve it.  I'm in the UK and we found a company in...I think it was Slovenia perhaps... Eastern Europe in any case.  And that's NOT the norm to do, but it's the only way to get the scale/price match that the customer needed.\nThe other thing to consider is that there are two reasons for an MOQ.  The first is technical limitations - the machinery needs to have 'X' amount in the tank for example, otherwise it doesn't calibrate correctly.  The other reason, and it's something you can use to your advantage, is that the MOQ brings in the amount of money that they need to justify the equipment's use, labour, setup or whatever is the case.  They figured that a price of 'Y' is what the market wanted, and therefore to get that price you have to do 'Z' amount of packs/litres.\nIf this is the case, then you can talk to *the right person* in the business, probably a manager of some kind, and say 'Hey, I want to do less than your MOQ, and I'm happy to pay more for the privilege'.  That can open a lot of doors.  You may get some pushback because, frankly, that's not the way people think, or at least have been trained to think.  And you'd better have your stuff together, because otherwise you'll be a pain in their butt in multiple ways and they'll lose faith in you in a hurry.  You may be paying more per unit, but you'll still only be hitting their MOQ in terms of cost, so you're not worth much, and you're making them upset the applecart for MOQ levels of cash.\nIf you're doing liquid filling into stick packs then I'd suggest that going the DIY route should be an absolute last resort, and even then you need to go into it accepting that you are burning your money, and if you do get anything out of it then that's a bonus, not an expectation.  Here's the reasoning for that (as someone that's been there, done that):\nThe machinery is Chinese.  Which is fine, but it's not the most precise stuff in the world.  It misses some 'finishing touches', which for a lot of things is OK, but if you're a n00b, then you have to do a lot of troubleshooting.  For example in your case your product is a) liquid and b) will likely contain sugars. The stick is heat sealed. Any liquid that is where the heat seal is going to be, just a drop even, will either absorb the heat, and therefore not seal, and/or it'll caramelise the sugars.  Eventually you'll have massive carbon/crud buildup on your sealing surfaces, and you'll have porous packs because they didn't seal properly.  There are ways around this, but they don't come in the machine, you have to engineer them yourself, and you have to be permanently on the lookout for problems.\nThe other thing to be mindful of is that the MOQ for the sleeving is often 1,000m or more for custom printed stuff, and you have to know what temps/time/surface you want when you order.  If you contract pack then they tell you, or help you to get there.  DIY means... DIY.  I'm not saying DON'T do DIY, I'm saying do it as last ditch/learning experience and have a very VERY rigorous set of tests that you frequently use (like every 15 mins) to check the integrity of the packs.  It's almost certainly not a long term business plan, but it might get you a result in the short term if you're prepared to put up with the compromises."

It's just that watery toast doesn't taste well.\nedit: now to me it appears to be an interesting question to compare water, mixed fat spreads (e.g. magarine), fat replacement spreads, butter and oil and see how they performe in weaking the toasted bread."

        "top_comment": "Assuming this isn't carbonated, you ideally want to find a different way to get the can to higher than atmospheric pressure. They'll be far more physically robust, as an added bonus.\nNormally this is done with liquid nitrogen. You use a dosing system to put a drop in (exact quantity will depend on a few things) immediately before applying the lid and sealing the can. It'll start evaporating immediately, purging oxygen from the headspace, and if you've got the nitrogen quantity right it should continue to expand to pressurise the can. Too little and you'll have the same issues you're seeing now, with squishy cans,, and too much will give you overpressure issues when you pasteurise - best case it'll deform the base of the cans, worst case they'll start exploding in the bath. The process of working out the right dosing time can be surprisingly exciting!"

Net zero tortillas have something like 19 grams of carbohydrate and 19 grams of fiber. My favourite one so far iin terms of edibility (but not price, yikes) is Arnold's keto thins. These are flat sandwich buns that have 4 grams of net carbs (21g/17g of carbs/fiber respectively).\nHow do they make this stuff? Is there something I could be adding to my own baked goods at home to crank up the fiber content into that territory where the net carbs are in the low single digits? I'm reading about stuff like ground chicory root, inulin (which I think is derived from chicory root), psyllium fiber (which I take in capsules already) and other things that are added to the industrial breadmaking process to achieve this result.

        "top_comment": "These products are generally made with type 4 resistant starch which is a highly cross linked starch that resists enzymatic digestion.  So it largely behaves as fiber in our bodies.  If regular fiber is used the dough absorbs way too much water.  The key is that whatever is digested is very slow and your blood sugar should not go up much.  You can find videos of people testing their blood sugar after eating various low carb breads.  Good to test since these products are not designed for diabetics and aren\u2019t tested as such.  In addition, some companies doing this may not be aware of everything I\u2019m saying here.  And the analytical methods for analyzing fiber and carbohydrates are expensive and still not very good.  So blood sugar testing is key.  The major bread brands will be most accurate.  There are starches on Amazon you could use but probably cheaper to purchase the bread."

I kind of know what flavor mango is supposed to be, but I just really taste parsnips. What is interesting though is that the first time I had parsnips (tossed in oil and roasted with carrots) I thought they tasted like taro flavored milk which is also weird. When I ate the mangos, I got carroty vibes as well as that same taro flavor I got in the parsnips. Is my taste perception just weird or is there some logical reason this is my experience? Also to note, there was a post on\nr/culinary\nabout 4 years ago about someone who had parsnips for the first time and thought they tasted like mangos.",
        "top_comment": "Just subjectively speaking here I think green mango definitely has a parsnip/carrot flavor to it. There's a bit of that present in the ripened flavor but I've never thought about mango overall tasting like parsnip before."

Both houses offered no guidance on usage. I pinged the sales guy at one of the houses, and he'd said he'd send over more info and didn't.\nI heard that from someone else that these are 'proprietary blends', that I *don't need to know* what's in them, and that they get stuffed in the sock drawer of natural flavors.\nI'm not keen on using something I don't know the composition of.

        "body": "Hi everyone,\nI currently have a protein milk powder that I\u2019d like to turn into a shelf-stable liquid product (in a jar, can, bottle, or flexible pouch). My goal is to develop something that doesn\u2019t require refrigeration until opened.\nFrom my research, UHT (Ultra High Temperature) processing seems like the ideal sterilization method for achieving shelf stability, but I\u2019m running into a roadblock, it has been incredibly difficult to find a small-batch copacker in Ontario, Canada that offers UHT services.\nHas anyone here worked on a similar product or faced this challenge?\nA few questions:\n1. If UHT isn\u2019t accessible, what\u2019s the next best processing method to achieve shelf stability (e.g., retort, hot fill, aseptic, etc.)?\n2. Are there any small-scale copackers in Ontario or nearby that you would recommend for this type of product?\n3. Any advice for early-stage producers looking to test this kind of formulation without massive minimum order quantities?\nThanks in advance for any leads or insight!",
        "top_comment": "Retort is your only other option. pH is the primary driver of what determines processing for a beverage. Milk/protein beverages almost always have a pH >4.6, which means UHT or retort are your only options for shelf stability.\nSmall scale & UHT do not mix. Even for retort, you\u2019re still talking ~500gallons at a minimum. UHT, you\u2019re probably in the 50-75k unit MOQ at smaller facilities. The equipment & cost needed for these lines simply don\u2019t make sense to run for small volumes.\nCapacity is fairly tight in both spaces, with new facilities typically filling their capacity before even opening. Pilot facilities do exist for testing purposes, but do not produce sellable product\nThe blunt truth, as someone who\u2019s career has been in this space - if you don\u2019t have hundreds of thousands to spend to get your brand started, UHT/retort is not the best place to start. Either explore refrigerated products (lots of complexities, but smaller volume friendly) or a powder blend to start."

It did not taste like pineapple when I tasted it here. I then had that mixture with fried crab cakes, poached eggs and siracha hot sauce and it tasted like it.\nI know that this probably is not reproducible, but is there anything like \"these are the chemicals in pineapples you added these together and it accidently matched\" someone could do? I just feel like I'm insane since I have no idea how spinach ends up tasting like pineapple.\nEdit: I also asked in askculinary and their response was \"fermentation did it\".",
        "top_comment": "I can't help you with a scientific breakdown of pineapple enzymes, but I often work with miso and am really familiar with it. Are you using white miso by any chance? The lighter color varieties, especially white, tend to be sweeter and almost fruity, whereas the darker ones are more salty and umami. If you pan fry something with white miso on high heat and it gets a caramelized, crusty texture, it will bring out that sweet, acidic fruitiness even more.\nAlso, pineapple and fruits similar to it (durian comes to mind) have very funky, fermented-adjacent flavor notes and I think if you're picking up on that part, it reinforces the idea that you're getting miso flavors or one of the other fermented pastes you used and you're getting your wires crossed. If any of the stuff you added at the end kicked up the sweetness factor at all (some srirachas can be sweet) you could very reasonably arrive at pineapple."

So technically per the label in the US, it contains no calories.\nIt\u2019s probably somewhere in the middle. A lot of the science I\u2019ve seen suggests it might vary person to person depending on the gut microflora and to the extent that they utilize the fiber source (for example, they can create short chain fatty acids as by products that are caloric). But if you\u2019re comparing 0 cal to 2 cal per g, it\u2019s not a night and day difference. If you eat 20 g of oat fiber per day you\u2019d maybe be underestimating by 40 cal per day (which is basically noise considering the variance that nutritional labels are allowed)."

        "top_comment": "What's the full recipe you're using? And how long are you waiting after adding the xanthan?\nOne potential thing you can't really tell from the label is what corn syrup they're using. Depending on the amounts of different sugars (and longer-chain carbs) in them, some corn syrups can be fairly thin, and others can be quite thick. The stuff you can buy in a typical grocery store lies somewhere in between, but I've worked with syrups that couldn't be pumped without being heated up first because they were so viscous."

Our major products are meat and fish and cheese. Fresh and Frozen.\nI work as the Semi driver who delivers the food to the end location, however this is more of a mom and pop operation than I ever worked for, and my pay reflects that. So if a problem shows up, I pitch solutions.\nWe have large blue chests for frozen items that are filled, then topped with dry ice. Which are then loaded into a refrigerater trailer. The blue bins are breaking or have gone missing/been stolen.\nI pitched making our own frozen chests, walled with thicker insulating foam than the blue chests with a few extra features which are unimportant for this question. The chests would be made with wood. Pine wood frame surrounding a plywood cooler with 3 inches of insulating foam and another plywood shell.\nMy boss asked it would be good safe. I told him I would have to look into it. However, I'm sure the blue bins we already used are not washed between deliveries.\nWould those conditions be FDA safe for transporting food for 5 hours to their end destination. Another clarification: all food would be in its own cardboard box, and likely bagged within that. No direct food contact with the wood cooler!",

        "top_comment": "I will also add that CPGs are a different breed than brands. First, CPGs have core supplier lists. This usually includes the two or three flavor houses that they work with on everything. If you aren't on that list, good luck. The flavor houses provide more than just flavor. They are an extension of R&D and marketing, and sometimes have dedicated flavorists and applications scientists servicing the account. The CPG may ask a flavor house for entire concepts, and leave the finishing touches and scale-up/launch to their internal teams. I've personally been involved with massive beverage product launches that included my team designing the product from the ground up and presenting it to the CPG. They basically like it, ask for tweaks, then take it and run. The more a flavor house can be a partner and alleviate the leg work that is involved with product development, the more they are going to work with you on future launches. CPGs are incredibly bloated on every function outside of R&D."

I recently made a plant milk (mostly of peas and quinoa, but a couple other things too for texture) and was left with pulp afterwards, which I dehydrated and ground to make a powder. I figure it's a given that this powder is fiber-rich and probably decent to add to muffins or something, but I'm curious about the protein content as well. I am not really prepared to do a Bradford or Biuret assay in my kitchen, let alone anything more sophisticated. Is there a sloppy, imprecise, mainly physical method to guesstimate this at home that doesn't require any fancy reagents beyond what I might concoct from my cupboard? I've got plenty of test tubes, flasks, Falcon tubes, and the like. Do not have a centrifuge at home unfortunately. Thanks in advance and I understand how silly this is!",

What you could do, is run one of those assays in a ballpark way with just your eyes and some reference, or look into the literature to see is someone has done a kieldahl or dumas and extrapolate that to the masses you used for an estimate"

        "top_comment": "Rutgers has state ag extension specifically for this reason. Its what they do. And fortunately they're a LOT cheaper (and sometimes free if you hit certain requirements).\nYour key is to get someone who is considered a \"Process Authority\" to rubber stamp your Plan. Once you have a PA they will be able to walk you thru the process as they do this stuff all the time. They can tell you what a realistic sampling plan looks like. Sampling plans need to be statistically sound but theres a lot of variance with that depending on the process, batching etc.etc.\nHowever generally speaking 90 days of run time is the usual standard for an initial validation.\nEdited: forgot to include testing. You really cant get around testing product for your initial validation especially if its a unique process. Its needed to prove your process is considered safe. However, once again your PA can help with this as long as you include in their scope.\nTesting for basic microbial growth is fairly cheap (depends on the lab contract etc but usually only like 30 to 50 bucks for the very basic stuff  - testing for specific pathogens can be expensive if you need to test for a serotype."

        "body": "Hi all, I have a small nut butter startup, packaging in 8oz PET jars with a 70/400 lid. Since mid-July the jars started leaking. We initially didn't have an induction heat seal, so I added one and tested a jar on my roof for 24 hours. In 85 degree heat with direct sun the actual jar warped and melted, causing a leak. The real world examples had never warped to such an extent but it leads me to believe that the leaks were caused by the jar itself melting, not by the lack of an induction heat seal.\nWe're going to keep the seal regardless but the plastic jar itself seems to be an issue now too. The jars I see at the store are PET with an induction safety seal (as is mine). Why are mine melting and leaking when bigger brands aren't?\nI'm mailing in bubble mailers with ground shipping, so there is a lot of opportunity for issues to arise, but I'm unclear if there's a packaging/jar solution to this or if it's just a matter of not letting them get that hot in the mail in the first place.",
        "top_comment": "Definitely re-evaluate shipping. When sending out samples of nut butters we would routinely utilize our regular PET jars. We shipped in small boxes. I have seen whole pallets of jars melt/warp in the sun if left out when receiving so it doesn't take much depending on the quality.\nAnother thing about induction sealing, the surface between the jar and the foil needs to be clean and free of oil. Any oil will disrupt the seal."
