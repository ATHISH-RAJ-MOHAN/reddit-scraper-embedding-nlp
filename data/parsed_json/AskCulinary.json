Every guide online says to remove the amount of flour and water the original recipe calls for with the amounts in your sourdough starter, but what if the original recipe doesn't call for any water? That's the part I'm confused by.\nFor reference, original recipe calls for 593g of all purpose flour, 2 1/4 tsp of dry yeast, and 300ml of milk, no water. My sourdough starter is at a rough 1/1/2 ratio, 40g starter, 50g water, 80g flour.\nHow would I go about calculating the amount of sourdough starter to replace the dry yeast in this specific case?\nRecipe here >>\nhttps://inbloombakery.com/london-fog-rolls/?utm_campaign=feed&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=later-linkinbio"

Looking to see if I could get any help in saving a batch of homemade refried beans.\nFollowed this recipe, instant pot refried beans, no soak necessary:\nClean, rinse, and pick out broken beans, 1 lbs pinto beans\nPlace into instant pot, with 8 cups of water and salt\nPressure cook HIGH for 45 minutes, once done/vented, let the beans sit in there for 20-30 minutes\nMeanwhile, heat up some bacon fat (this is where i went wrong, i had kind of burned some of my bacon strips, did not strain out the small burnt bits, and poured all the bacon fat into my pan, yes I made a bad mistake/lazy, it was late at night) and saut\u00e9 1 jalapeno and 1/4 onions, both chopped.\nSpoon over the pinto beans, reserve 1 cup of bean water. Adjust seasoning (i sprinkled in a combo of garlic salt and kosher salt) and mash and add water little by little to desired consistency\nMash to preferred consistency, enjoy with some cotija cheese!\nAs mentioned in step 4, I was a dummy and used.... burnt bacon fat. My refried beans now have that acrid/bitter taste. I read online to add some baking soda, lime juice, agave, honey, butter, or lard to kind of offset/neutralize that \"bitter\" taste.\nAnyone else go through this bad mistake when trying to make refried beans for the first time? Any help would be appreciated, as I don't want this batch to go to waste and had lots of ideas to pair these refried beans with, thanks so much, apologies for the long read!"

I've had mushrooms before where they were large and tender enough to give a good bite without going as far as being rubbery.\nIs there a way to achieve that? Or is this something that I need to work around via a smaller dice? Maybe dice thinner rectangles as opposed to cubes?\nCooking method was: I browned the ground beef, removed from the pot, then tossed in the mushrooms and onions with some salt. Used the moisture to deglaze and then added olive oil to Sautee after moisture evaporated.\nI got a good color on the mushrooms but the texture still wasn't tender.\nOn a side note, i once had a grilled portabella that was the most tender and teak like mushroom ive ever had. Does letting the mushroom grow longer and open up have a big effect on the texture?\nThanks in advance."

In addition to that, I opened it one evening and mould had started growing around the rim. I googled what to do and it said to change the water everyday and clean the base.

I rest the dough for 30-40 minites and when I roll it out it shrinks back up alot. is the AP flour working against me? am I under hydrating and creating gluten strands with initial kneading that adding moisture won't help after the fact? should I be resting longer than 30 minutes to get a softer dough? tyia I'm very new to this and most online recipes only say to bring out the inner grandma and just understand the dough with your heart so you can make great pasta and that's not very helpful lol. tyia for any tips or tricks"

Here\u2019s what I do: rehydrate around 10 to 15g of dried mushrooms (I tried morels and chanterelles, separately) in a regular sized bowl (as one where you would serve soup) of water. Then after rehydration in warm water (around 50\u00b0-60\u00b0C) for 30 min to 1h, I filter with paper towel or cheese cloth over a fine sift. I then reduce at a very gentle simmer (little to no boiling). By the time it\u2019s reduce by half it\u2019s already extremely bitter. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s normal, if there\u2019s a way to avoid that, and also if rehydrating the mushrooms in a minimal amount of water in the first place would help me get something more concentrated without the bitterness.

        "body": "I\u2019ve been trying to perfect a lamb curry at home, but I\u2019m struggling with getting the lamb tender without it turning into mush or taking too long to cook. I typically use shoulder or leg cuts, marinate them in yogurt, garlic, ginger, and spices for a few hours, and then steam everything on the stovetop for about an hour. Sometimes it turns out well, but other times the meat is still a bit chewy.\nWhen I was researching, I found this lamb curry recipe on\nLord & Lion\nthat looks delicious but I don't have their exact ingredients but still trying to get it right. Maybe I should marinate it overnight in yogurt to help break down the meat, followed by slow cooking? I\u2019m not sure about the exact timing or if there\u2019s a better method.\nAny tips on cooking times, cuts, spices or techniques to achieve that tender lamb? Thanks!"

        "body": "Hi All,\nAn excerpt of a written recipe from Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s Book \u2018Simple\u2019 is included below which relates to my Question and Discussion.\nDue to be unfamiliar with Bulgur, I followed this recipe exactly, using a scale and exact measurements and following each step exactly as it reads. The Bulgur I used was Macro Organic Australian Bulgur Wheat, which I would say is Coarse.\nUnfortunately, the end product had absorbed all the cooking liquid, and was still seriously undercooked. I attempted to fix this by adding a small amount of boiling water, however the Bulgur was in the twilight zone of being undercooked, yet seemingly unable to absorb more liquid. The dish was entirely inedible.\nI am curious if a finer Bulgur was used without this being specified in the book? Or if perhaps there is a fundamental issue hidden somewhere in someway.\nI am eager to hear tips and advice relating to this matter.\nThank you to those who have read and considered my post! :)\nWritten Recipe (excluding the not relevant steps and ingredients):\nAdd the remaining oil to a large saut\u00e9 pan (for which you have a lid and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and fry for 8 minutes, stirring a few times, until caramelised and soft. Add the garlic and allspice and fry for 1 minute, stirring continuously until the garlic is aromatic and starting to brown.\nAdd the cherry tomatoes, mashing them with a potato masher to break them up. Stir in the tomato paste, 400ml of water and I teaspoon of salt. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 12 minutes. Add the bulgur, stir so that it is completely coated and then remove from the heat. Set aside for 20 minutes, for the bulgur to absorb all the liquid.\nIngredients:\n105ml olive oil\n2 onions, finely sliced (320g)\n3 garlic cloves, crushed\n1 tsp ground allspice\n400g cherry tomatoes\nI tbsp tomato paste\n400ml Water\n250g bulgur"

I realize that the warm crock pot will add another layer of difficulty to this, but I can't even get this stuff to turn out well fresh, so the crock pot isn't even a consideration yet.\nMy problem is that I just can't get one to turn out at all. Always gritty, soupy, chunky, overall just bad texture.\nI'm shredding my own cheese.\nI've tried the classic roux, milk, and slowly adding cheese as it melts. I've done this with skim milk, as well as skim milk mixed with half and half to get the fat content up a little bit. Gritty.\nI've done Kenji's evaporated milk sauce. Gritty.\nI even got sodium citrate. Did one recipe with milk, and then one with water. Neither one resulted in a sauce any smoother than the other two, just saltier.\nFor cheeses, I've been using basic Kraft or store brand blocks. The pepper jack turned out the worst, but the cheddar ones were all also awful. I have a block of Cabot cheddar I'll use for the next one if the consensus is the quality of cheese, this stuff should be at least a LITTLE better.\nI'm losing my damn mind. Someone please save me. I don't care if it's roux, evaporated milk, or sodium citrate, or a combination of them, but I need this to work. I've come too far and wasted too much mental real estate. I need this to work for my sanity!\nEdit: comments got locked for some reason, but I really appreciate all of the input, thanks! One person had linked an article on sodium citrate with a good ratio, and I gave that a whirl, turned out fantastic! I'll experiment with the roux method again at some point, a lot of good advice was given there."

        "body": "Hello,\nI am trying to make a traditional Vietnamese cookie/cake and it requires arrowroot powder. Unfortunately the arrowroot powder that I have used in the past hasn\u2019t gotten the cakes to bloom. I have also tried other flours such as using wheat starch, cake flour, and 50/50 ratio of cake flour and wheat starch but results were like domed cupcakes and not the bloom that I wanted. The recipe is relatively straightforward with 1kg eggs with the shell on, 1kg sugar , 1kg arrowroot powder and vanilla whipped until light and smooth and the batter floats on water. It is usually cooked in a brass mold with a lid over charcoal until it blooms."

Reheat in the air fryer or a quick sear for some color.\nWould it be easier to remove the skin raw, or after sous vide-ing them?\nThanks!\nEDIT: I went ahead and sous video them, then took the skin off.

I had to cautiously roll the paper around to gradually unstick tortillas each time, but even like this, sometimes tortillas got teared apart from unsticking.\nSo here is my question:\nIs there a better material than baking paper for pressing tortillas?\nWas my mixture too wet? (I followed the recipe [and even put less water than written) but felt that the mixture may have been too wet [much softer than Playdoh], the baking paper felt wet after the first pressing)\nIn all videos on youtube they are using parchment paper too and their tortillas come off pretty quickly just with gravity, but also in these videos the \"dough\" looked much more stiff (playdoh like).\nI'm using blue corn harina (Real maza) if it helps."

However, I'm not sure how it might impact the bake.\nI'm specifically wondering if the frozen dough will result in any problems that don't come up for fridge temp dough. I assumed it would take a bit longer to bake and spread out a bit less, is there anything I'm overlooking?\nRecipe copied below:\n8 ounces unsalted butter (2 sticks; 225 g; see note)\n1 standard ice cube (about 2 tablespoons; 30 mL frozen water)\n10 ounces all-purpose flour (about 2 cups; 280 g)\n3/4 teaspoon (3 g) baking soda\n2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1 teaspoon table salt (4 g)\n5 ounces granulated sugar (about 3/4 cup; 140 g)\n2 large eggs (100 g)\n2 teaspoons (10 ml) vanilla extract\n5 ounces dark brown sugar (about 1/2 tightly packed cup plus 2 tablespoons; 140 g)\n8 ounces (225 g) semisweet chocolate, roughly chopped with a knife into 1/2- to 1/4-inch chunks\nCoarse sea salt, for garnish\nMelt butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, gently swirling pan constantly, until particles begin to turn golden brown and butter smells nutty, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and continue swirling the pan until the butter is a rich brown, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to a medium bowl, whisk in ice cube, transfer to refrigerator, and allow to cool completely, about 20 minutes, whisking occasionally. (Alternatively, whisk over an ice bath to hasten the process.)\nMeanwhile, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Place granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on medium-high speed until mixture is pale brownish-yellow and falls off the whisk in thick ribbons when lifted, about 5 minutes.\nFit paddle attachment onto mixer. When brown butter mixture has cooled (it should be just starting to turn opaque again and firm around the edges), add brown sugar and cooled brown butter to egg mixture in stand mixer. Mix on medium speed to combine, about 15 seconds. Add flour mixture and mix on low speed until just barely combined, with some dry flour still remaining, about 15 seconds. Add chocolate and mix on low speed until dough comes together, about 15 seconds longer. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate dough at least overnight and up to 3 days.\nWhen ready to bake, adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C). Using a 1-ounce portion scoop or a spoon, place scoops of cookie dough onto a nonstick or parchment-lined baking sheet. Each ball should measure approximately 3 tablespoons in volume, and you should be able to fit 6 to 8 balls on each sheet. Tear each ball in half to reveal a rougher surface, then stick them back together with the rough sides facing outward. Transfer to oven and bake until golden brown around edges but still soft, 13 to 16 minutes, rotating pans back to front and top to bottom halfway through baking.\nRemove baking sheets from oven. While cookies are still hot, sprinkle very lightly with coarse salt and gently press salt down to embed. Let cool for 2 minutes, then transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.\nRepeat steps 4 and 5 for remaining cookie dough. Allow cookies to cool completely before storing in an airtight container, plastic bag, or cookie jar at room temperature for up to 5 days."

        "body": "Hello! Tonight we made yellow curry using a curry paste brand and recipe we have used countless times before with no problem. We used Blue Elephant yellow curry paste, with Thai Kitchen coconut milk, using the following recipe:\n1) cut chicken into bite size pieces and slice onions\n2) sear chicken in pan with a little bit of oil (just brown outside of the chicken)\n3) throw onions in pan and add a bit of curry powder to everything\n4) add can of coconut milk, 2tbsp of curry paste, and mix until very light orange (fully mixed)\n5) bring to a boil\n6) cover and reduce heat to low\n7) simmer for 15-20 minutes\n8) take lid off and stir until sauce thickens\nWe have cooked this recipe probably 100 times, enough that tonight (like other nights) we walked away and did something else while it simmered.\nWhen we came back it looked different than it ever had. I wish I could attach a photo, but it looked like somebody had essentially removed all the curry paste and poured two cups of oil into the pan. The chicken and onions were just sitting in a pool of oil, with a little bit of yellow from the curry paste on everything. But it was not curry. There were also little burnt brown/orange blobs which I think were somehow the curry paste??\nIve heard of emulsions separating, but Im not sure if that is what happened here? If so (and even if not) why did this happen? How can we avoid this happening in the future since this is one of our favorite meals?"

If everything is going to end up as small pieces of meat in the same sauce - is there any point to pre-marinating the meat (compared to just adding those ingredients at the same point you sautee your aromatics)?\nThe only way I can see this being different is having different flavour compounds present in/on the meat when you sear it before it is stewed/braised. Otherwise I can't see why there would be a significant difference here, so I'm seeking your expertise to educate me."

Here is everything I did. Seasoned a lamb shoulder with salt and pepper, browned in a pot and then removed. Added onions, celery, carrots and cooked for 10-15 mins until soft. Added tomato paste and cooked again. Deglazed with some red wine and then added crushed tomatoes, garlic, oregano, thyme, a few bay leaves, and some beef broth. Added in the lamb leg and brasied for about 6 hours. The meat itself was tender though a little dry. At the very end I added some heavy cream and some parmesan cheese and then added the pasta. The lamb just didnt have much flavor. Some things I\nthink\nI did wrong; added too much liquid. The sauce just didnt have a good consistency and was very watery, I have the same problem when I try to braise oxtails. I can never quite get it to be a gravy. I also think I should have cut the lamb into smaller chunks and seared each one better. The color of the lamb wasnt the deep brown that I wanted. And lastly I think i added too much cream and too much pasta, the ratio of meat to pasta was way off and the sauce was like a light creamy orange. Would love to hear other tips for this dish!"

        "body": "Hello, i\u2019m hoping to get some second opinions on my turkey recipe that is a mix of my family\u2019s recipe and a compound butter recipe for TheGoldenBalance.  I have included the recipe and ingredients below, I will be using a 13.5lbs turkey that\u2019s spatchcocked and am cooking with a standard oven, not convention. I\u2019m a little iffy on the cooking time and temperature. I\u2019m concerned that cooking the bird at 425\u00b0F the entire time is going to burn the compound butter. Should I reduce the temperature, or tent the turkey during the cooking process? Or just put the butter under the skin only and some oil on top? Thanks for your help, I appreciate it.\nIngredients\nFor the Dry Brine\n1/4 cup Morton Coarse Kosher salt, 1 tbsp baking powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, and 1 tsp black pepper.\nFor the Compound Butter \n\u00bc cup fresh sage leaves, 2 Tbsp fresh thyme leaves, 2 Tbsp fresh rosemary leaves, 6 cloves garlic, 2 sticks (1 cup) softened butter, 2 Tbsp honey, \u00bc cup hot pepper paste, \u00bc tsp black pepper, \u00bc tsp chili powder, \u00bc tsp paprika, \u00bd tsp onion powder, 1 Tbsp lemon zest (from about 1 lemon), 2 Tbsp orange zest (from about 1 orange)\nRecipe\nStart by spatchcocking the turkey by cutting out the backbone, and cracking the chest. Then preemptively loosen the skin before the dry brine tightens it. Next mix the dry brine ingredients into a bowl and apply to the exterior, and interior cavity of the turkey evenly. Place the turkey in its roasting pan, and set on the bottom most shelf in the fridge for 12\u201324 hours.\nTake the turkey out of the fridge and let it come up to room temperature for half an hour to an hour. While waiting, make the compound butter by first adding the sage, rosemary, and thyme leaves into a food processor blending into a rough chop. Next at the garlic, and continue blending until the mixture is a fine paste. Finally add the rest of the ingredients into the food processor occasionally scraping down the sides. Set aside.\nWhen ready to cook, preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F.\nWhile the oven is preheating, lather the compound butter liberally under the skin, along with a thin layer on top of the skin. Ensure that the tips of the turkey\u2019s wings are tucked into breast or under the turkey\u2019s body.\nBegin roasting the turkey at 425\u00b0F. Leave the turkey alone until the skin starts crisp and bubble and begin basting 1-2 times during the cooking process. Make sure to rotate the pan 2/3rds of the way through to ensure even browning. Once these thickest part of the breast reaches 150\u00b0F or slightly above, take the turkey out of the oven and let it rest until it reaches 165\u00b0F."

I usually wait for the oil to get hot enough for wood to bubble when I put it in the pot, then fry the first batch of chicken for 15 minutes on medium-high heat. After that, I just put in the next batch and fry it for another 15 minutes. I season the chicken then I coat the chicken in plain flour first, then dip it into a wet batter (salt, egg, sparkling water, flour), then into the seasoned flour, and finally into the fryer. I use canola and sometimes vegetable oil.\nFrom what other people have said, how do I monitor the temperature to keep it consistent, and is this why the oil is turning black?"

So if we were to avoid freezing and try to just roast them on Saturday or Sunday (still a big \u201cif\u201d as we don\u2019t know if hubs will still be sick), the meat would be in the fridge salted/uncovered for 5-6 days.

I've tried using the spoon because that's what my mother always used, but I simply can't stir it by myself for the length of time it needs to be.  I have used a mixer on low with only one beater attached, but does this also affect the outcome of the fudge?

Anyone tried anything similar  before? Is it possible to get the potato to disappear into the broth or will it always separate out?\nEditing for more context:  The ramen dinner I'm planning will be a design-your-own bowl kind of thing. I will have both soy and miso-based tares (a soy, spicy miso, and lemon-garlic miso to be specific), and lots of topping options, including tofu, etc.  All the tares will be vegan (yes, I will avoid miso with dashi included). I will also have  a Paitan and tonkotsu broths, but want it to be possible to make a fully vegan bowl with the options available for a couple of the guests.\nSo, my main concern is that the mushroom broth might be a bit thin---will the miso tare options be plenty to give body or should there be steps to give body before the final bowls are assembled?

About 1.5 cups beef stock. 2 shallots finely minced. 5 garlic cloves. Some cranks of black pepper and salt. I put in 1 beef bouillon cube and 1 chicken bouillon cube. A few splashes of Worcestershire sauce. And lastly some dried thyme. I let them cook on high in the crockpot all day, frequently taking off the lid to bleed off some water to concentrate the liquid more\nEdit: I forgot to mention I\u2019m going to take out some of the liquid the mushrooms are in and reduce it and add a buerre main\u00e9 to thicken for a gravy for tonight\u2019s prime rib"

        "body": "I slow-roasted a 1.5 kg (about 3.3 lbs) tenderloin yesterday, and I\u2019d love some insight on a temperature quirk I noticed.\nHere\u2019s what I did: I dry-brined the tenderloin and left it uncovered in the fridge for about 30 hours. To get an even thickness, I folded the tail end of the roast and tied it up. I took it out of the fridge a couple of hours before cooking. Then I slow-roasted it at 120C (about 250F) on a normal (not fan) bake setting. It was the only food item in the oven, and I had it cooking uncovered in a baking tray, elevated on a wire rack.\nWhen the center of the meat hit around 47.8C (118F), I took it out of the oven, leaving it uncovered. No more than 5 minutes later, I used an instant read thermometer (a Thermopop) to find the coolest part of the roast. Interestingly, the coolest spot wasn\u2019t dead center vertically. Horizontally, it was central, but vertically it was about three quarters of the way up to the top of the meat. Further, the difference in temperature between what my eye told me was dead centre versus the coolest spot was about 5.6C (10F). Again, this was only a few minutes after removing from the oven.\nI will point out that both thermometers were giving the same reading when inserted in the same spot, so I know the equipment wasn\u2019t faulty.\nI\u2019m curious why the coolest area ended up there rather than exactly in the middle. Any thoughts from the community? Thanks in advance!\nEdit: I also can confirm I used the oven\u2019s \u2019Bake\u2019 function, and the user manual says the following: \u2018Heat radiates from the top and bottom of the oven and is evenly distributed by natural convection.\u2019"

My issue is I had butter oozing out of the dough the entire time that I was laminating the dough. I chilled for at least two hours after doing two folds (like everyone says to do), but the butter was always everywhere. The dough was also very difficult to roll out.\nThis could relate back to the measurement of the flour, and not being able to get the d\u00e8trempe to come together. I ended up needing two cups of heavy cream, and used dough hook on my KitchenAid to get it to come together.\nAll of this I can maybe forgive myself for, but the most bizarre thing happened when I took a piece of the dough and baked it just to test. With puff pastry, the layers are supposed to go up, but the layers were sideways like a fan. Like, I know I cut it the right way, so I\u2019m trying to figure out what I did wrong. At this point, am I better off getting store bought puff to make pastries with? Also, what kind of puff is okay to buy? The one at Publix has not gluten or dairy, so I don\u2019t know how they can legally call it puff pastry."

        "body": "Hello redditors!\nIm seeking help with my beef short rib recipe. I\u2019m using the American test kitchen boneless beef short rib recipe and am concerned I bought the wrong cut of meat.\nThe recipe calls for 4lbs boneless beef short ribs, and says to not substitute bone in for boneless. Which idk if I\u2019ve accidentally done that?\nI went to the butcher and stated that\u2019s what I needed and that it was for braised short ribs. The butcher said they could de-bone their short ribs and do it in an English cut for me. I said great!\nThen I learned that boneless short ribs aren\u2019t ribs at all but are the chuck portion of the cow? TBH I\u2019m very confused by this.\nSo, now I\u2019m concerned that I have the wrong meat for the recipe and less meat than needed, since they weighed it with the bones in. Here\u2019s where I need help\u2026.\nDoes using de-boned short ribs in place of boneless short ribs change the recipe timing (or anything else) at all?\nIs a chuck roast the same thing as boneless short ribs?\nIf I bought 1lb chuck roast and combined it with my 3lbs de-boned short ribs, would I be able to follow the recipe as is and cook it all together?\nAny general tips/tricks/advice for making braised boneless short ribs?!\nFull recipe:\nINGREDIENTS\n4 pounds boneless beef short ribs, trimmed\n4 teaspoons kosher salt\n2 teaspoons pepper\n2 cups beef broth\n2 cups dry red wine\n3 tablespoons packed brown sugar\n2 tablespoons white miso\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\n1 large onion, halved and sliced thin\n2 carrots, peeled and sliced \u00bc inch thick\n6 sprigs fresh thyme\n\u2153 cup balsamic vinegar\n3 tablespoons molasses\n2\u00bd teaspoons cornstarch\n2 teaspoons water\n1\u00bd teaspoons hot sauce\n2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley or chives\nBefore You Begin: For even cooking, buy ribs that are at least 4 inches long and 1 inch thick. Do not substitute bone-in short ribs. This recipe requires refrigerating the braised ribs overnight. Use a Dutch oven that holds 6 quarts or more. This recipe was developed using Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt. If you have Morton Kosher Salt, which is denser, reduce the salt to 1 tablespoon. Use a medium- to full-bodied dry red wine such as Pinot Noir or Cabernet Sauvignon. Serve with mashed potatoes or polenta and a green vegetable or our Apple\u2013Celery Root Salad.\nINSTRUCTIONS\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Pat beef dry with paper towels and sprinkle with salt and pepper.\nWhisk broth, wine, sugar, miso, and soy sauce together in Dutch oven. Add onion, carrots, and thyme. Nestle short ribs into pot so that they are nearly submerged. Bring to simmer over high heat, cover, and transfer to oven. Cook until fork can be easily slipped in and out of ribs, 2\u00bc to 2\u00be hours, using tongs to turn meat halfway through cooking. Cool ribs completely in braising liquid and refrigerate over-night or up to 3 days.\nRemove solidified fat from top of braising liquid and discard. Transfer ribs to large plate and refrigerate until ready to use. Strain braising liquid through fine-mesh strainer set over large bowl, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard solids.\nTransfer 3 cups braising liquid to medium saucepan (discard remaining liquid) and bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 1 cup, 20 to 25 minutes. Off heat, stir in vinegar and molasses.\nCombine cornstarch and water in bowl. Stir cornstarch mixture into glaze and bring to simmer over medium heat. Cook until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in hot sauce and set aside to cool slightly.\nWhile glaze cools, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer beef to cutting board and use paring knife to trim any large pieces of fat from surface of ribs. Blot ribs dry with paper towels and evenly space on prepared sheet. Brush all surfaces of each rib with glaze.\nTransfer sheet to oven and cook until beef registers 140 degrees, 20 to 25 minutes. Every 5 minutes, brush all sides of ribs with glaze and turn ribs so different side is touching pan. Apply 1 more coat of glaze to top of each rib and sprinkle with parsley. Serve, passing remaining glaze separately."

In step 2 it says to season chicken with pepper, then add to pot. My first question was why just pepper, which is what led me to think won't it just wash off?\nI've also found another example in\nthis recipe for glazed boneless short ribs\nI'm making for Christmas. You season the meat with a specific amount of salt and pepper as the first step, but if you follow the recipe properly you'd then be submerging it in liquid within 5 minutes. It also calls for patting the meat dry first, which doesn't seem necessary either when it's going straight into liquid anyway. When I prepped this last night, I skipped the drying step, and let the salted meat sit for 30 minutes before adding it to the pot."

Spoon the meringue into a large piping bag fitted with a plain nozzle and pipe concentric rounds to fit each drawn circle, piping two or more rings around the edge to form a nest. Bake for 2 hrs until they are crisp and lift off the paper easily. Leave to cool completely.\nStep 3\nWhisk the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche until stiff, then fold in the yogurt.

Loaf #2 smacks you in the face with the smell right away.\nSo I\u2019m wondering - will it taste bad? Can I change this? What aspect of the technique difference caused this? Is it because I added the yeast separately/towards the end?

        "body": "Not sure if this is the right tag or not, but here\u2019s what I\u2019m doing:\nIngredients:\n2 eggs\n3 T duck fat OR unsalted butter\nHardware:\nWell-seasoned Lodge 10\u201d cast iron skillet\nFish spatula\nProcedure:\n1. Put skillet on stovetop (largest burner on electric glass top) on medium low heat (around 3 on the dial) to preheat. Make coffee (Chemex/pour over). After coffee is brewed (about 5-10 minutes by the time the water comes to temp, beans are ground, and the brew completes), return to skillet. \n2. Break eggs into a small bowl\n3. Add fat to the skillet and wait for it to melt and shimmer (if using duck fat) or melt and start to foam (if using butter)\n3. Add eggs to skillet and cook until desired doneness\nI bought some duck fat to up the flavor on some cooking projects, and I thought I\u2019d try frying my morning eggs in it after seeing some folks recommend it. While frying in the duck fat did produce the super crispy edges that I love in fried eggs, the stickage was something else. When I fry my eggs in butter (in the exact same skillet), I don\u2019t get the crispy edges that I love, but the eggs glide around almost immediately\u2014to the point that I can even confidently flip them to cook them over medium. With the duck fat, I have to really force the spatula under there (forget about flipping them) and the yolks have ended up breaking in the process (and I like a runny yolk).\nSame eggs. Same pan. Same temp. Same heat. Same time pre-heating. Same amount of fat. Only variable as far as I can tell is the type of fat.\nAnyone have any ideas as to why the eggs stick with duck fat but not butter?"

But the resulting compound butter tastes a bit bitter... And one thing that I know is that a bitter fat is not a good sign. Or is this to be expected? I mixed it with the shrimp's stomach (not the thin vein along the tail, the big one in the head) which is black when I extracted them. That must've been the main cause. I'm a bit new at this, did I mess it up by mixing the shrimp stomach raw? is it salvagable somehow? I'm planning to use them to make an emulsion sauce for pasta. Thanks."

Use a slotted spoon to transfer the lardons to the slow cooker pot, leaving as much of the fat in the pan as possible.\nAdd 1 tablespoon oil to the frying pan with half of the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and fry over a medium heat until really crispy and golden brown on all sides. Repeat with the remaining thighs, adding a splash more oil if the pan looks dry, although some fat should render from the chicken skin too.

        "body": "I just finished attempt #7 at making a cake with the reverse creaming method, and I am stumped on how to make a cake with the texture I'm looking for. I've been trying to make a cake with a fine crumb but a sturdy, velvety texture. Everything points to using the reverse creaming method, which I've had significantly better outcomes with than the traditional creaming method. However, even with the reverse creaming method, it's still not quite right.\nI primarily use recipes from Sugar Geek, as her recipes are solid and have great detailed instructions. Most recently, I've been working to perfect a marble cake recipe to my liking; I started with her original recipe, which still turned out great, but have since tweaked it to the below:\n\u2022 454 g\u00a0cake flour \u2022 454 g\u00a0granulated sugar \u2022 1\u00a0tablespoon baking powder \u2022 1\u00a0teaspoon\u00a0baking soda \u2022 1\u00a0teaspoon salt \u2022 227\u00a0g\u00a0unsalted butter, softened\n\u2022 142\u00a0g (5 oz)\u00a0vegetable oil \u2022 172\u00a0g (6 oz)\u00a0buttermilk,\u00a0room temperature\n\u2022 225 g (8 oz)\u00a0buttermilk,\u00a0room temperature \u2022 4\u00a0large\u00a0eggs,\u00a0room temperature \u2022 A splash of OJ (0.75 oz / 21 g) \u2022 2\u00a0teaspoon\u00a0vanilla \u2022 1 oz sour cream*\n\u2022 6 oz (170 g) espresso, cooled \u2022 2 oz (60 g) cocoa powder \u2022 1 oz (30 g) brown sugar \u2022 Dash of baking soda\nI then follow the instructions she has on her recipe, including the same mixing times and speeds. When I made the original recipe the first time, the overall texture was good, but the crumb was borderline dry (and very crumbly) - one wrong move while you're eating it and you'll end up with a crumb(s) in your windpipe. I decided to try adding a teensy bit more liquid and more fat; for attempt #2, I added 2 ounces of full-fat sour cream. That made the crumb borderline gummy, so on the next attempt, I tried just 1 ounce. That seemed to help with the moisture and crumb levels, but still not entirely.\nWhat can I do to make the cake a little firmer (i.e. more structured) while also reducing how crumbly the cake is? Is this just the nature of a cake with the reverse creaming method? I know the whole point of this method is to reduce gluten development - which produces that tender, velvety texture - but is there a way to achieve a texture with a middle ground between cakes made with reverse vs. standard creaming?\n(To note: even with the outcomes I'm getting, I still prefer the texture to creamed or oil-based cakes, as I want to avoid a bigger, fluffier crumb.)\nFor reference, my dream \"goal\" is to make a cake with a similar texture and crumb to those damn Costco and Sam's Club sheet cakes; as a home-baker of almost 20 years, they blow 99% of bakery cakes out of the water. They're always light and fluffy, yet still rich and velvety; they have a fine crumb, but are somehow still not dry or crumbly. The reverse creaming method is the closest I've ever gotten to that texture, but it is still not fully there.\nTo be clear, I DO recognize that the texture I want to achieve may simply not be possible without the commercial-grade ingredients that bakeries and stores use, which I can accept... I just didn't want to give up on that goal until I tried experimenting with it myself haha. Is there anything else I can try to get these cakes closer to what I'm looking for?"

        "body": "Hi everyone I would love some help. I\u2019ve been trying to make short ribs at home twice now. Thankfully the meat is turning out fine but my sauce I slow cook them in always splits while in the oven. I know my temperature isn\u2019t too high I never but it above 300 F in the oven and I remove the excess fat before putting it in the oven. But every time I take it out of the oven when I\u2019m done and try and make a sauce it\u2019s split and a complete mess. I\u2019ve tried adding warm/cold water to re emulsify but that doesn\u2019t work either. Any suggestions?"

I have a member of the family who doesn't eat pork and a member who doesn't eat beef and for one reason or another I am forbidden from using duck (don't ask.) I'd like to make the dish all at once and not make multiple variations so as to not single people out for dietary restrictions/preferences. I want to keep it simple, 50/50 pecorino and Parmesan, I use a mix of whole eggs and egg yolks, and black pepper.\nNow to replace the guinciale my first thought was lamb belly and perhaps a few days of curing but sourcing and time restrictions could make that near impossible. I'd appreciate any recommendations on replacements, preferably things reasonably easy to source as I'll be in London Ontario and have limited time.\nMy thoughts are turkey bacon, turkey sausage/pepperettes, some kind of dried lamb if I could find it although I wouldn't know where to look, or again lamb pepperettes or something and just sub olive oil as needed for fat content.\nWhat would you use to replace the crunchy flavourful bits of guinciale and bring in some similar flavour?"

(into refrigerated \"pucks\" if you will)\nAny pre-prep possible for cacio e pepe?\nAny tips on setup? The current plan is to have one large 8.5 qt stock pot with individual colanders for each serving size.

I baked it in the oven after mixing the noodles into the sauce for about 20 mins to crisp up the top but also to try and integrate the cheese a bit better.

Add the cavatappi, and cook according to the package instructions, stopping two minutes before al dente. Drain the pasta, and drizzle a bit of olive oil over the top. Toss to combine and coat the pasta with the oil, and set aside.\nkosher salt, 1 pound cavatappi noodles\nIn the same pot over medium heat, add the heavy cream, milk, black pepper, mustard, thyme, paprika, and garlic cloves.

        "body": "I am trying to understand a technical issue rather than asking for a recipe. I make a very simple cream based sauce regularly and it used to be stable every time, but recently it has started separating and I cannot pinpoint what changed.\nMy usual process is gentle heat, a small amount of butter, then heavy cream, followed by freshly grated cheese. I keep the heat low, whisk continuously, and add the cheese in small batches off direct heat. The ingredients have not changed and the ratios are roughly the same as before.\nWhat puzzles me is that the sauce looks smooth at first, but once it warms back up it starts to break, with fat separating and the texture turning grainy. Lowering the heat further and whisking more slowly has not solved it.\nI am wondering if this is more about temperature control, fat to protein balance, or the type of cheese reacting differently as it melts. Could small variations in heat timing or residual acidity be enough to cause this, even when the method feels identical?\nI am trying to understand the underlying mechanism so I can correct it consistently, rather than relying on trial and error. Any insight into what specifically causes a cream sauce to destabilize under gentle heat would be appreciated."

None of my local chinese grocery stores carry it and I don't really want to order any. So, instead, I decided to mix my own.\nFor 4g of penghui, I used,\n- 1 g  KCl (salt-free salt, just potassium instead of sodium)\n- 2 g  Na2CO3 (alkaline)\n- 1 g  NaS2O5 (sodium metabisulfite)\nI read from various sources that original penghui contained some amount of these (amongst other salts, but these are what I had on hand), but I could not find any mass breakdown.\nThe dough turned into a viscous non-newtonian fluid mess haha. it was unworkable and took an hour and various solvents to clean from my counters. So, I tried again using,\n- 2 g      KCl\n- 1.5 g    Na2CO3\n- 0.5 g    NaS2O5\nThis was better, but I believe it was still too fluid. I was able to get usable (and tasty) noodles, but I had to manually roll out each noodle to ensure a uniform thickness. Of course this is probably a skill issue, but the dough did not respond the way it does in the video so I'm convinced it was a mix of the two.\nCan anyone suggest alternative amounts to make the powder? Or different salts to add? I know the real commercial powder has sodium polyposphate or something as a flocculating agent but I don't have any of this on hand. Thanks!"

I have found that making my own food for the trail is also much more delicious and healthier than what everyone else seems to be eating anyway.\nIn preparation for this next stretch, one thing on the menu is a backpacker's cottage pie. I can do the ground beef separate, incorporating bread crumbs to assist in the re-hydration. My plan is to cook the vegetables with herbs and seasonings in another batch with a sauce that needs to be thick enough to at least sit on a piece of parchment in the dehydrator. On the trail, I will top this with a quick Idahoan pack of instant potatoes and Voila! For those that don't know how much a good meal does for morale when you've walked 15 miles, trust me, even a subpar  cottage pie is a real treat.\nI, due to the gluten free bit, cannot use flour. I opted in for tapioca starch. After some seasoning with my heart, I ended with a delicious gravy and vegetable sauce that's ready for drying.\nMy question is with re-hydration. I have managed to screw up dishes in the past (not backpacking meals) where i have cooked cornstarch too hot and it \"broke\" and i'm wondering if tapioca starch will do that, too. Should i cold soak this recipe on trail and reheat over low heat? Will it matter? Is there a thickener you think might work better for this purpose?"

Itl usually come back together with a bit of whisking but if it's been sitting for a while or overnight you might have to whisk it for 5+ minutes and even then it might just refuse to emulsify.\nIs there anyway to make it a bit more stable without changing the recipe completely, is there an issue with my technique?\nI thought it might depend on the composition of the tahini itself, so I always make sure it's really well mixed before using, that doesn't seem to change much.\nI always whisk the tahini smooth with the water & garlic mixture before adding the oil.\nAdding more tahini doesn't really seem to help, I suppose you could throw an egg yolk or something in there maybe?

I have since made the same recipe 3-4 times since returning and struggle to get my cream mixture thick. I find my mixture comes out too runny and whiter than the cream we made in the class (the cream in the class was more yellow). I believe I am repeating the same steps and ensuring I do not over work the cream whilst mixing and do not use a whisk in the cream mixture as it can become too thin.\nI'm not sure where I'm going wrong. The cream mixture was so runny it made the lady fingers float when I attempt a 2-layer tiramisu.\nWhere am I going wrong?\n500 g of mascarpone cheese\n4 medium eggs\n100 g (\u00bd cup) of granulated sugar\n2-3 espressos\nunsweetened cocoa powder\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0Make the coffee \u2013 (Double Espresso) - Set aside and let cool.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0Separate the egg whites from the yolks.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0Whisk the egg whites until stiff/fluff - electric whisk 3-5 minutes\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0Whisk the egg yolks with sugar until light and smooth, 3 minutes.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0Add mascarpone cream + egg whites into egg yolk mixture and slowly work with rubber spatula, ensuring to fold from bottom.

I freeze it in a thick hockey puck shape, and when I got to roll it out I get these big crevasses from the edge towards the center. They're basically impossible to fix.\nI think it might be me over kneading the dough? I just don't make it often enough to have a lot of chances for testing a bunch of changes. Recipe is 180g flour, 10g sugar, 8g salt, 1 stick butter, 3 tbs water. Doing all kneading by hand.\nDon't get me wrong it tastes great and I love the flakiness, but the large tears make it a pain to roll out, and I never see videos with people dealing with the problem.\nSecond question: I like to use larger apple chunks for texture and so I've been cooking the apples down on the stove. Is there a way to get this step consistent? Poking hot apples with my finger to test if the outsides are soft feels like a bad way to get consistent results.\nThird question: How do you add cornstarch? Do you make a slurry like normal, or do you toss the apples with some before putting them in the shell? Is there going to be a difference in results either way? I don't cook the apples long enough to reduce the liquid down, so I still have a decent amount of water in the bowl.\nForth question: Is there a trick to getting a gradient of crumble sizes? I sort of enjoy the random larger chunk of crumble in the bowl for a bit of variety when eating. As of now I've been hand pressing butter into flour at about a 2:1 ratio. 1 cup flour to 1 stick butter, then ~100g of sugar total, plus 2/3rd cups of oats. Even with the larger chunks of butter left alone, I don't seem to get those larger crumble chunks.\nThanks in advance!"

In just 20 minutes, the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e overcooked massively - completely curdled, rising then deflating the edges and pulling from the edge. I don't understand what went wrong. I checked the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e much earlier than the recipe said to but still it overcooked.\nThe cream was barely warm when mixed with the egg yolks. The oven is calibrated correctly using a separate oven thermometer. The cast iron was room temp when placed in the oven. The tray was set on the middle rack.\nThe only slight change was that I didn't have a tray larger than the cast iron so I used the drip pan in the oven instead. It was still tall enough to hit the middle of the cast iron, so I assumed no issues there.\nIf I tried it again, maybe 10 minutes is enough to cook it just right???

I hear evaporated milk is a common substitute for heavy cream so I thought maybe I would just use that since I don't have any heavy cream on hand.\nWould I substitute 1:1 or change my ratios a bit? Should I increase any other ingredient (egg, whole milk, sugar) when using evaporated? Or would I be better off just using milk and skip the addition all together?\nIngredients if necessary:\n3 cup whole milk\n1 cup cream (evap. Milk in this case)\n6 egg yolks\n1/2 cup sugar\nPinch of salt\nEgg whites whipped\nOptional alcohol, about 1/4 cup rum or brandy.\nIn all honesty I eyeball the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove) and vanilla so I could guess a bit over a teaspoon for each besides cloves which I probably do about 1/4 tsp.\nAfter that I just make it the traditional way: heat the milk, whip the yolks with the sugar, carefully incorporate ingredients together then cook until thick, cool down, fold in whipped egg whites when serving.\nUpdate: Made it last night, still tasted great! I was going to substitute 1:1 but I didn't want a leftover can so I ended up pouring the whole 12oz can in. I just cooked the nog a bit longer than I usually do (without overheating it, be careful of that) to get it thicker. It still came out a bit lighter than what I was aiming for but my family loves it!"

What I mean is, is there a difference between viscosity and stickiness/other properties that the sugar takes when being heated.\nLots of questions! Not sure I\u2019ll get full answers but appreciate any help"

        "body": "Hello! This could be more of a food science question that a culinary one, but I'm really not sure. No issues with our recipe, just baffled by an odd 'reaction' (for lack of a better term) with steak coloring\nThe TLDR of the question:\nI cooked Ribeye steaks via Sous Vide to 137, then left them in the vacuum seal and put them on ice and seared them 2 days later while camping. Off the stove, they looked well done after cutting into them, but within 20 minutes the color returned and they looked perfectly Medium, pink throughout with small gray band where we seared them. What gives?!\nFor some added context- We usually cook our steaks Medium to Medium Rare. If we're doing a pan sear, we usually use the Sous Vide to get the desired temp, ice bath for a min or so right out of the sous vide, then sear in a ripping hot Cast iron or Stainless steel. This turns out excellent every time.\nWith Ribeyes, we like to sous vide them at 137 for a couple of hours to render the fat, then sear them through the same method as mentioned above. We were camping over thanksgiving weekend so we figured we'd sous vide a few steaks and then throw them in the cooler and sear them at the campsite for dinner. I knew theyd be chilled through so getting that perfect sear while still heating the steaks through would be a challenge, but my wife and I were shocked when we cut into the steaks and saw them gray edge to edge as if we cooked them well done. Initially we were really bummed that we'd ruin a few good rib eyes (for our standards, at least) but we cut them into strips and basted them with butter and made sandwiches with them and they were good all the same. In fact they were much better than I thought they'd be as a well done cook. I just assumed it's because the fatty ribeye is somewhat forgiving and we basted them in melted butter.\nThat is until about 20-30 min after cooking we looked at the leftover strips of steak we cut earlier. The color had returned to them and they were pink edge to edge, just like we expected to see and just like our normal Rib eye sous vide -> sear usually turns out. So what gives?! We were bummed about the sear for no reason. It looks like we had cooked them absolutely perfectly! Im assuming something about the cold kept the color out of the steaks maybe? I honestly have no idea why they would have genuinely looked well done in every slice only to have their color return later. Any ideas on what caused that reaction?"

I just went to the store to get everything to try again but with a lot of broth. I\u2019m going to add the broth a little at a time until the raw dressing is the consistency I like of the cooked stuffing.\nI had only mentioned the size of the bird and the safety as my concerns, but truthfully, I\u2019ve also been unable to make this any time of the year that doesn\u2019t involve a large stuffed bird. So if I can make it regularly as a dressing I will be so happy.\nThank you\nHi all, my family has a recipe we\u2019ve been using since before I was born (late 1960s). But I have had some problems recently that I\u2019d like help with.\nThe stuffing is one pack of bulk breakfast sausage, one box of wheaties cereal, and one chopped onion. It all gets mixed together and stuffed in the bird. It cannot be made outside of the bird. It just doesn\u2019t work.\nBut two things have happened. The first is that we\u2019re told that stuffing is not safe, and we should stick to dressing. The second is that my family is now grown and having dinner with their in-laws and my siblings are having family with their grown children and grandchildren. So if I were to ignore safety guidelines and stuff the bird anyway, I\u2019m no longer buying birds that are big enough to hold all the stuffing.\nRemember when I said it must be made in the bird and it doesn\u2019t work as a dressing? In the bird it get gooey and clumpy and deliciously moist. As dressing it is dry and crumbly and not so delicious. I have tried adding broth, eggs, butter, and probably other things I can\u2019t remember. But nothing has ever worked. How can I make this dressing clumpy and gooey and deliciously moist?"

I had mine in the oven, with butter and olive oil for 30 min and it didn't brown.\nI saw many videos advising to take your turkey off at 155 and it would heat up to 160.  I have a Meater thermometer and I took my 18lb bird out of the oven at 156 and it only heated up to 158 in the particular spot I was probing.\nWhen carving it all seemed done except one small section which I just didn't carve.\nOverall this turkey did turn out moist.\nMy 10 lb bone in breast on the BGE was measuring 170 / 180 in many parts of the turkey but one section I kept watching only made it to 154 when I finally decided to pull it.  Unfortunately, this turkey turned out mostly dry.  FYI I had rotated the turkey breast twice during the cook.\nI used to be OCD about probing every part of the turkey and making sure every inch is at 160, but now I am not so sure this is the best way to do it.

I rinsed it and patted it dry after taking it out this morning, and then put compound butter (about the total of 2 1/2 sticks worth) under the skin. I seasoned the top of the skin with salt and pepper, and put it in the oven at 355 on a tray until it reached 150 F, basting every 30 minutes (this took about an hour and 40 minutes). Afterwards, I took it out of the oven and let it rest for about an hour or so.\nIt turned out pretty dry when I ate it, despite me seemingly following all the steps correctly. Possibly it was the the fact my compound butter and brine had salt and herbs? Maybe I could've taken it out at 145 F?

Need help with eggplant parm make ahead strategy that will yield the best results.\nSauce will be made today and eggplant is sliced and sweating as we speak. Im not looking to make a breaded version, but a lighter one. Question is should i cook the eggplant t today, and assemble then bake everything together tomorrow? Or should i keep the slices raw in the fridge (post sweating) and then cook / assemble / bake tomorrow? To cook, i was likely going to pan fry in olive oil or bake before assembling since I\u2019m not doing a breading.\nI\u2019m worried i should have waited to slice into them until tomorrow, but too late now. Thank you!!"

Instead of using vegetable oil as the fat I used duck fat, and after two hours of stirring and not getting past the brown stage, we pushed the heat up and started getting some smoke but the roux finally turned a very dark brown. Tracking the temperature with an IR gun, it got to around 380*F when it finally progressed. We stored it in the fridge and then today tried to continue with the recipe. Sadly, when we added the roux slowly to the boiling stock while vigorously stirring it broke and nothing we did could bring it back together.\nThis sent me on a rabbit hole online to try and figure out what went wrong and what to do tomorrow. Was it a bad idea to use duck fat? The lower smoke point seems like it makes it harder to not burn the roux, and I am not sure if the roux failed because it was burned (we did have smoke at the end to go from peanut butter to dark brown color). From America's Test Kitchen, they seem to use way less dark roux and show an example of dark roux and say that if it is that color it's burned. On the other hand, you have Paul Prudhomme's videos on youtube showing incredibly dark roux.\nSo I have 2 main questions:\n1 - What tells you if your roux is burned? Is it the color or whether there was smoke during making it?\n2 - Should you add roux to a large volume of stock or the other way around?"

Or am I just creating a different variety of mushy mess?\nI don\u2019t need superfine, just to add to a bechamel base for cheese sauce. TIA"

I read somewhere that you should never use stainless on high than medium heat--I fear perhaps this was misinformation. I think I'm terrified to burn it or something so I never cook on high than a 5-medium. I heated my pan up, did the dancing water test, added oil and heated 'til it shimmered and proceeded to add some butter. I was in no means stingy on the oil in the pan, so I don't think it was due to lack of oil in the pan. I added my meatballs in, and let them sit. I probably waited about 5 minutes. I gave the pan a little shake and they were all stuck!!! I was so so upset about the whole order. the meatballs were pretty wet, so this maybe was the reason, but also no way, because I've cooked an egg in that pans before and it didn't stick this bad!\nAny ideas where I went wrong?"

        "body": "first, to be clear my q focus is not around flavour, but more around microbiology\nSo i keep 3 types of honey at home, Rowse that i use instead of sugar in basically everything from cooking to coffee, its my all around sweetener. then Raw honey i use to eat cold on occasion but mostly for ferments as it has active microbes eg yeast that are necessary for fermentation, then finally I have a MGO 260+ and UMF 10+ manuka honey that i only use cold as is, for eg in yoghurt or on desserts\nI'm looking at making a few things from ice cream to chocolate and wonder, if i use raw honey, will it effect the shelf life? I've avoided unpasturised honey to date for cooking and food prep for this reason but perhaps its unnecessary? i know honey itself is antimicrobial to an extent but struggling to find a clear answer, all honey comparisons seem to be around their flavour profile or benefits, though nobody is really looking at thermal degradation effects\nanybody know this/tried different raw/unpasturised vs pasturised and seen a difference? eg. maybe even bread will turn faster\nI cant reply to any comments annoyingly but the idea that honey is just sugar and water are coming from people that dont understand honey...at all\nfor a start, high grade manuka:\nUnique compounds\nMethylglyoxal (MGO)\n: This is a key antibacterial compound that gives manuka honey its potency.\nDihydroxyacetone (DHA)\n: Another signature compound found in manuka honey.\nLeptosperin\n: A unique compound found only in manuka honey, which is also used to authenticate its origin.\nVitamins, minerals, and antioxidants\nVitamins\n: Contains small amounts of vitamins like B6, riboflavin, and niacin.\nMinerals\n: Rich in minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.\nAntioxidants\n: Includes various phenolic acids and flavonoids, such as caffeic acid, gallic acid, quercetin, and pinocembrin.\nOther components\nAmino Acids\n: Contains amino acids, which can support immune function and recovery.\nOther bioactive compounds\n: Includes a wide range of other compounds such as kojic acid, methyl syringate, and various arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) that may contribute to its health benefits.\nRaw honey is also not sterile at all:\nTypes of microbes in raw honey\nBacteria:\nPrimarily\nspore-forming bacteria\nlike\nBacillus\nspecies, which can remain dormant in honey but can germinate and grow if moisture levels are high enough. Other bacteria can be introduced from the environment, and their presence can indicate a secondary contamination.\nYeasts:\nCommon yeasts like\nSaccharomyces\nand\nCandida\ncan be found in honey, especially if the moisture content is high, leading to spoilage and fermentation.\nFungi:\nA wide variety of fungi, including molds like\nAspergillus\nand\nPenicillium\n, can be present, contributing to the overall microbial diversity.\nnet result is I'll experiment myself, noone even bothered to google for 20 seconds to know what they're talking about. If raw honey was sterile, how would i make ferments for a start -_-. Bacterial/Fungal spores can also undergo extreme temperatures and conditions like low water content for ages and then revive in the right conditions.\nThanks Texnessa I'll probably do that..."

Both thermometers kept up with each other until about 175 c. After that, the hanging thermometer barely moved at all while the probe thermometer kept slowly rising. Eventually, the probe thermometer wrapped around to what I would assume is 250 c but the hanging thermometer barely passed 200 c.\nSurely this means the hanging thermometer is junk, the probe thermometer is correct, and I just suck at cooking with a new gas oven, right?"

If it doesn't, I'm keen to get your feedback on my Friendsmas menu. (Specific questions after each menu item.) Menu and thoughts below.\nCanapes\nSourdough Bruschetta\nMushroom Duxelle Tartlets\nBoth fillings are easy to make in advance and then it's easy assembly just before KO. The duxelle forms part of the roulade filling, so I'm just making more of it. (SortedFood fans will know I'm ripping off their Christmas Unleashed menu.)\nMains\nSpiced and Glazed Chicken Crown\nI'm also doing Christmas dinner, so I'm subbing out turkey for chicken to keep costs down. I've used the Bon Appetite recipe previously and found it to be excellent. However, I'm wondering if I can get the same quality of glaze on a 1.8kg chicken as I would a 6 or 7kg turkey. It'll cook a lot quicker. Is there anything I can do to slow the cook and develop a better glaze/crust?\nChicken Roulade Stuffed with Pork, Mushroom, and Truffle\nI'm sous videing the roulade a couple days in advance, so all I have to do is crisp the bacon on the day. I've goofed my practice runs (sus videing to 55 celcius instead of 66), so my main question is on serving temp. The recipe says to finish in the pan with the option to heat through in the oven. What temp should I be aiming for? I don't want to overcook it and lose all the nuances you get from sous viding.\nSides\nDouble Cooked Goose Fat Roast Potatoes\nThese are dialled in. I can prep them the night before and roast them the day of. No questions.\nRoast Carrots with Harissa and Creme Fraiche\nI like these in isolation. However, I'm slightly concerned it's adding a whole bunch of flavours that might not jive with the rest of the menu. Do you think I get away with some rogue harissa?\nBeef Dripping Yorkshire Puddings\nThese are mostly dialled in. I'll prep the batter a couple days in advance and cook the day of. Two lingering questions:\nI usually use neutral oil or goose fat, but want to dial up flavour wherever possible. First time using beef dripping. Any concerns or advice other than using it just like another fat?\nAnd I'm running a little short on oven space (one full-size oven and a combi microwave/oven). I've toyed with cooking these a couple hours in advance and reheating before serving. Is there any way to get a decent result doing this?\nItalian Cabbage with Pangrattato\nI wanted something with a hint of being healthy (ignore the 200ml of olive oil!). This is pretty dialled in. Similar question to the harissa carrots, though. Does this go with the wider menu?\nGravy\nAnother Bon Appetite recipe. I've made this before and it's been great. No real questions, other than whether it'll freeze (minus finishing acid and MSG) okay. If it would, it'd take pressure off my fridge and hob.\nBreads\nBig old open question. I'm really struggling for a good dinner roll recipe. I want something soft and pillowy, rather than a thick crunchy crust. If you have any recs, I'm all ears."

I figured since other people did it in the videos and stuff I watch and lemon slices were such an integral part of a lot of dishes, that, clearly,\nI\nmust\u2019ve been doing something wrong.\nWhile it\u2019s not as pretty without the rind, removing it did solve the issue entirely.\nI\u2019ll test out the suggestion of thinner slices and different lemons some other time since I\u2019m curious about that one\nThanks again \ud83d\ude4f"

How long should I bake for, approximately?\nMy back of the napkin math (i.e., a guess based on logical deductions) is to check them at about 20-25 minutes (because 80 minutes divided by 3 = about 27 minutes) and go from there.\nImportant (possibly) is that my oven seems to cook faster than what recipes say the bake time will be. So i usually have to pull things about 15% sooner than as-written.\nFor those interested, the chicken pie is prepared by lining a bowl with plastic wrap, then lining with dough, then adding the different layers (hard boiled eggs with herbs; caramelized carrot & onion; fried chicken; and par-cooked rice), and finally using more dough to make the bottom of the pie. You flip the whole thing over onto a cookie sheet and bake. It\u2019s delicious."

        "body": "I've never made a multi-course meal by myself before and frankly in general I would consider myself a fairly novice cook, but I want to host a Thanksgiving dinner with (4 or 5) friends just for a bit of fun. Only one of us actually grew up celebrating Thanksgiving, so I felt I could take some creative liberties with the meal and decided to go for somewhat fancy vibes with mostly native New England autumn ingredients for the main flavors of each course and apple elements to tie them all together. I mostly settled on the number of courses just by coming up with components I wanted in the meal; I realize it does seem like a lot for a novice, but a lot of it fairly turned-off-brain-able (the amuse-bouche, the entree, the salad, the dessert), though I'm open to simplifying it. Regardless, since I have total control over the meal, I'd like some feedback from more experienced cooks to make sure it's as good as it can possibly be. Here is the menu:\n0. Amuse-bouche: Goat cheese, apple compote, and maple syrup tartlets\n1. Soup: Creamy mussel soup with apple cider and lardons\nWould it be odd to use apple cider instead of wine to steam the mussels? Also, one member of the group is vegetarian. I'm making carrot lox for his appetizer and an oyster mushroom steak for his main, but I can't think of a good alternative for the soup. I'm open to changing it entirely if the consensus seems to be that this, the appetizer, and the main consecutively would be too much, though I couldn't think of any good alternative. I did consider that something like a squash soup would fit the theme very well, and mushroom soup would also work well, but unfortunately I despise all squashes/gourds in all forms and my partner generally dislikes mushrooms (which, by the way, is criminal) and we would be responsible for consuming any leftover ingredients so I don't think either would work...\n2. Entree: Smoked salmon verrines with crushed crackers, cream cheese, and apples\nIs this an okay combination? Is there anything I should add or remove?\n3. Main: Pan-seared duck breast with plum gastrique and pommes fondantes\n(Duck because I don't love turkey, and duck is technically more accurate anyways, not that we're really going for historical accuracy here.) This is definitely a spot where I'm stuck. I think I need to add something else here, something either bright or acidic, maybe a bit crispy, and preferably colorful to contrast with the other elements, but I just can't think of anything! Also, I chose plum gastrique because I (clearly!) favor fruits, and plum seemed to fit the theme better than options like orange or cherry, but I'm still concerned that it's out of place. Also x2, unless I cook the duck breast entirely on the stovetop, I'll need the oven for both the duck and the potatoes. Is 400F an okay temperature so that I can do both at the same time? Also x3, I'm planning to serve apple sorbet as a palate cleanser, but I don't know if I should serve it before, during, or after this course; I'm leaning towards serving them at the same time.\n4. Salad: Dandelion greens, pickled apples, goat cheese, candied pecans, and maple-balsamic vinaigrette salad\nI'm not set on the greens here. If dandelion greens aren't available then I'll use kale, but if there's anything more thematically appropriate then I'd like to hear! I'm also somewhat concerned about the repetition of goat cheese and maple syrup, but I'm hoping that there's enough space between the amuse-bouche and this that it's okay, especially since the amuse-bouche is of course so small.\n5. Dessert: Poached apples with dark chocolate ganache and vanilla ice cream\n6. Coffee\nI'll serve the coffee with apple cider caramels as sort of 'mignardises'.\nIs this generally an okay menu, or am I out of my mind? Do I need more vegetables, or should bread be included with any of these courses? And when should I plan to start serving food? I'm especially concerned that these dishes don't actually go together as well as I think they do or, though maybe it's silly since I admitted to actively taking creative liberties, that it's not Thanksgiving-y enough. I'd like feedback specifically on flavors, textures, temperatures, and ease of cooking all this while also trying to socialize. Thanks!"

I'm not making from scratch, planning on buying the kind they sell in the refrigerated section of the grocery store (probably either Wegmans or Safeway, if that helps), they're the smaller kind. There will be approximately 10 of us, and at least one person is vegetarian and this would be her \"main\". But we're doing potluck style so this will be one of many dishes (turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing. mac and cheese). How much do you recommend I make? I'm also open to any suggestions for a sauce, if you have them as well. Thanks!"

If I got the second rice cooker, I would ostensibly bring my first rice cooker to work and use it there, although this isn't very important for me to have.\nMy questions are:\n-Do Cuckoo pressure models make better rice? The only information I could find online was that pressure models make \"stickier\" rice but that's somewhat vague. If this is the same \"sticky\" used to describe Korean instant rice bowls, then that would be great i.e. the grains stick together but still have a dry, al dente texture. If \"sticky\" means wet and soft, that would be undesirable.\n-Does induction heating have a big impact on end result?\nI'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions to help guide my quest for the perfect bowl of rice."

But I did, for 24 hours. ~500g beef, ~1% salt by weight, 1 entire lemon, squeezed.\nPossibly important\n: first time I'm using a Mexican style citrus squeezer to marinate meat\nmeant for stewing\n. I bought a Mexican style one specifically to get the essential oils out of the skins, and the difference is tangible in other applications, but surprising if relevant in this case.\nBrowned the meat and gave it a generic chili treatment; spices and a bit of tomato paste. Steady simmer for ~3 hours until tender, but not falling apart. Stew's been resting for a while now, and still there's concentrated lemon flavour in the meat itself, but not noticeable at all in the liquid.\nI don't mind it at all; it's welcome heterogeneity, but I didn't expect it, and it never happened before to me.\nUpdate: after a few more hours of the stew resting at ~7C, the lemon flavour in the meat (submerged) has halved. Can't say I'm noticing it having moved into the broth (would take great dilution).\nIf anyone can recreate this experiment, then it could be a situational argument for serving stew fresh vs. the day later.

I washed and baked the eggplants in foil until nice and soft, blended them (peel included), and used them that way.\nHere's the thing, the eggplant paste after baking/blending tasted good, but after dehydrating, it no longer tasted like eggplant. It still tasted ok, just not as good as eggplant usually tastes.\nSo my question is, would you have any recommendations on how to retain the eggplant flavor when dehydrating?

The process is pretty simple, add 50:50 by weight of the fruit and sugar, and let it macerate through osmotic pressure. The sugar will draw out the syrup and \"dehydrate\" the fruit.\nI've done it on some local fruit called the \"lovi lovi.\" It is a deliciously sour fruit, but unfortunately, full of hard small seeds just like a guava. I have the \"juice\" or \"syrup\" and the pulp which is now more akin to a paste with the hard seeds embedded on it.\nMy question would be, how do I salvage the pulp? How do I isolate the seeds so that I can use the pulp by resugaring it to make a jam? I've done marmalade using citrus solids while keeping the syrup separate.

I\u2019m using the curry guy cookbook.\nEDIT: have posted receipt below\nCHICKEN KORMA\nServes 4 or more as part of a multi-course meal\nIngredients\n    \u2022 4 tbsp ghee, rapeseed oil or seasoned oil (see p7)\n    \u2022 2.5cm (1 in) piece of cinnamon stick or cassia bark\n    \u2022 4 green cardamom pods, lightly bruised\n    \u2022 1 tsp garlic and ginger paste (see p18)\n    \u2022 3 tbsp sugar, or to taste\n    \u2022 6 tbsp ground almonds\n    \u2022 2 tbsp coconut flour\n    \u2022 700ml (3 cups) base curry sauce (see p22)\n    \u2022 100g (3\u00bd oz) block coconut or 4 extra tbsp coconut flour\n    \u2022 800g (1\u00be lb) raw chicken breast, cut on the diagonal into 5mm (\u00bc in) slices, or pre-cooked stewed chicken (see p26)\n    \u2022 1 tbsp garam masala (see p14)\n    \u2022 125ml (\u00bd cup) single (light) cream, plus a little more to finish\n    \u2022 1 tbsp rose water or to taste\n    \u2022 2 tbsp cold butter (optional)\n    \u2022 Salt\n\u2e3b\nMethod\n    1.  Heat the ghee or oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. When small bubbles begin to appear, toss in the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods. Let the whole spices flavour the oil for about 30 seconds then stir in the garlic and ginger paste. Fry for about 20 seconds before adding the sugar, ground almonds and coconut flour.\n    2.  Mix into the oil and pour in about 250ml (1 cup) of the base curry sauce; it will bubble up nicely. Break up the block coconut, if using block, and add it to the simmering sauce. It will dissolve and give your korma a nice light yellow tone.\n    3.  Pour in the rest of the base curry sauce, then add the chicken. If using raw chicken, press it right into the sauce so that it cooks quickly and evenly. You can add a little more base curry sauce if you need to, as it will boil down anyway. Swirl in the garam masala.\n    4.  When your chicken is cooked/heated through, remove the cardamom pods and cinnamon, and stir in the cream. Add the rose water and finish with the butter, if you want. Season with salt to taste and check the sweetness, adding more sugar if needed."

        "body": "I bought a pack of frozen whole quail from a supermarket and opted to just slow-cook and shred the meat. Nothing fancy, just popped them in whole with some broth and spices for 4-5 hours.\nIt turned out great... except for two of the quail ended up exuding some mysterious dark, pasty material. No idea what it was. It was a dark brown and smeared when it touched anything solid. To be honest, my first reaction was that it looks like shit, and that immediately put me off.\nI just decided to trash any of the meat that got contaminated, but I'd like to avoid this if possible next time I get quail. Any idea what the mystery paste might have been? My theories are:\nBlood that coagulated and cooked\nSome kind of organ left inside that liquefied\nActually just bird shit after all\nFor theories 2 and 3, I assume I'd have needed to clean the cavities out prior to cooking. (Though given this isn't a whole turkey, I'm unsure exactly how to do that without spatchcocking them). Otherwise I'm mostly at a loss."

Note of importance, I cannot order glutinous rice flour, 20$ isn't the end of the world for the one time, but if I like dango I will most probably hyperfixate on it for a while and then that price tag becomes a monetary problem.\nSorry if I broke a rule or other, I'm really tired atm but if I don't do this now I WILL forget about it.

I'm trying to understand the science behind these options, and I'm worried the lack of recipes for chocolate creme mousseline compared to \"plain\" indicates that the chocolate version is a lot more tricky to achieve due to the nature of the chocolate (hateful, fickle, delicious).

The box includes instructions for \"cornbread (johnny cake)\" but the 8\" x 8\" pan results in flatter pieces of cornbread than I like, and it tends to dry out. What I really want to do is make a cornbread loaf in a glass Pyrex loaf dish with the following dimensions: 8.5\" x 4.5\" x 2.5\". I figure it would take two boxes, 2 eggs, and 2/3 cup of milk (double the recipe) or maybe even triple the recipe, but beyond that what should I change? The box says to bake at 400\u00b0 -- 15-20 minutes for muffins or 20-25 minutes for johnny cake but I wonder if the baking temperature and time could be tweaked? And/or maybe the addition of more milk, or a bit of sour cream could elevate it a bit and make it more moist? I'm not loyal to a particular brand either so if anyone knows of a different brand that works well in a loaf pan I'm all ears.\nThank you all in advance!"

The smell I am describing is intrinsic to poorly raised chicken, resulting directly from poor farming conditions.\nIn contrast, quality free-range and organic chicken lacks this poor smell.

I guess it denatured the proteins that coagulated? Seriously that was magic\nEdit 2: yes, all I did was add fine baking soda and it worked. If you used any Velveeta or other cheese with an emulsifying salt it will foam and bubble probably due to the presence of acid, but after that you will have a perfectly smooth cheese sauce. When cheese overheats the proteins seize up and form clumps. Adding baking soda to this overheated cheese Will denature those grainy proteins back into the liquid, and all will be right with the world."

But as soon as I'm cooking for like 8+ people (and usually 20+people) at once, The fresh pasta has multiple problems.\nSome of the long beautiful pappardelle pasta ribbons break in peices, some ribbons of pasta stick together, some ribbons of pasta get stretched, all creating an inconsistent plate of pasta - Guests dont really notice and are still giving compliments saying it's delicious, but I know the dish could be so much better if all the pasta ribbons were intact, seperate, long and wide, as I would have my fresh pasta come out if I were cooking for 1-4 people.\nMy current cooking/serving strategy: Ragu sauce is made the day before, and then sits in a slow cooker to  just keep warm on the side during service for me to use when needed. The pasta is finished being made about 1-2 hours before serving, dusted with flour and left on a drying rack to stay seperated from eachother, at service I will have a large pot of boiling water that I'll then dump all the fresh pasta into that was just put into nest shapes on a baking sheet 10 minutes previously (I stir the pasta every 30 seconds or so). I'll wait until it's just before al dente, scoop out into a massive mixing bowl with a large sieve, and mix/toss the fresh pasta with ragu sauce, then use tongs to individually plate the pasta in a twirl shape in each bowl, top with more ragu sauce & parmigianno, and send the dishes out to guests.\nUsually as I mix/toss the pasta in the massive mixing bowl with some ragu sauce is when I start to notice some of the pasta stretching/breaking and some ribbons are stuck to eachother from cooking.\nIf any one has any ideas on why this might be happening, and what I should do to fix that, that'd be great thanks :) - Keep in mind I only have the home kitchens of my clients to work in, but can buy/bring any/all the gear I could need."

What are they called?\nEdit:\nI got some similar references to what I look for:\n- What we had is a Doufeu cast iron\n- There is also Staub Self Basting System\nBut what I look for is a lid only, for a range of saucepans.\nMeasurement, plate as a lid, lowest simmering:\n- Without water in it: lid plate is almost 90\u2022C , vapor loss over 100g/h\n- With water in the plate: lid temperature is about 73\u2022C, vapor loss below 5g/h.\nSo this means I loose almost no vapor, and that's why the cooking smell is barely noticeable (and all the aroma stays inside).\nA redditor pushed me to do measurement, a great idea, but the same redditor was annoyed about my answers (maybe a language barrier thing)."

I\u2019m thinking not enough olive oil or old ingredients or a combination, but let me know what y\u2019all think.\nI\u2019m out of my monthly grocery budget and trying not to shop again until November, and used the last of several things I\u2019m low on.\nI used about a cup of loosely packed leaves that were a final harvest from a basil plant that\u2019s grown scraggly and pale without the summer sun. A third cup of parm grated from practically the rind. A quarter cup of pine nuts. Four small garlic cloves. And all the olive oil I had left, which was about 3 tablespoons once I poured it in.\nI made it in a small personal blender that can\u2019t blend without sufficient liquid, so I added a little pasta water to compensate for the lack of olive oil. Blended everything. It turned brown almost immediately.\nI also think I should have stirred in the cheese after blending everything else.\nI wonder if a squeeze of lemon juice would help the leaves stay green, or if that would change the flavor too much.\nAnyway, it tasted good \u2014 mixed it into a pound of pasta with a little more pasta water and a tablespoon of butter. It just looked terrible."

I look up \"tonic water bitter\" and ah, yea, this quinine ingredient, the main thing that makes it tonic water specifically, is noted to be extremely bitter to some people. would have been great if my parents were in that \"some people\"\nso now I've got this sitting in my fridge and I don't want to just dump it. but search engines have been ruined by SEO optimization, and trying to find solutions just nets me alternatives and the \"health benefits\" of the stuff. if I can salvage it, I want to, but figured I should ask here before I just start adding lemon juice and/or sugar blindly"

In my case, I don't want to make it too salty, especially for thinner meat with larger surface area, so I'm not inclined to put as much salt.\n2) When I dry brined chicken tenderloin for 48 hours, it seemed to make the texture a bit weird. I'm not sure how to describe the texture. It wasn't dry, but also wasn't soft. It looked like the surface that was exposed got darker. I wonder if the fridge shelf I put the chicken on was too cold. Does anyone know what I'm referring to? Wish I took a pic but hopefully this makes some kind of sense?"

I have not done this before, but stock at home is something I want to get better and better at because I think it's probably like the one thing anyone can do at home that will elevate the rest of their cooking to an entirely different tier.\nI followed Chef Jean-Pierre's recipe, but I think I used way too much water.  The stock never reached a boil, and temp probes showed 190 to 205 degrees for the entire 6 hour simmer.  This morning, there was not really much of a visible layer of fat on the surface.  I had strained it twice last night with a double mesh strainer, so only small particles remain.\nIs it possible that I have no fat layer because I used too much water?  Tonight after I am home from work, I was going to strain it a 3rd time through butter muslin cloth, and then reduce it down. Is this a suitable course of action, or can any of you reassure me that nothing is fucked here, man?  Just strain and reduce and it'll be fine?  I should have yielded about 6 quarts, and I think I am closer to like 10-12 currently."

        "body": "Hi folks. Simple question here. Canadian thanksgiving is coming up and I'll be in charge of cooking the turkey. It's only going to be for 3 adults so instead of a whole bird I'm going to be roasting a breast and a leg.\nI've used my 12\" stainless steel pan before to roast chicken in the oven. I like doing that because I can just stick it out of the oven and then put it on the stove to make a sauce or gravy immediately. I was planning to do the same thing this time.\nHowever I feel like there's just going to be too much meat for this plan to work. The turkey cuts are obviously way bigger. My guess is that it will lead to uneven heat distribution as well as the meat soaking/boiling in its own juices. I'm wondering if I should go and get a roasting pan before stores close.\nCan anyone confirm or deny this? Thank you in advance"

I did come across Iwisa and noticed it was advertised as a maize meal. I was wondering if I were to use Iwisa the same way as I would Maseca, would I still be able to make tortillas? I am so desperate but I want to ask before I make this purchase as money is tight right now.\nThanks so much to ANYONE that helps. I just want a corn tortilla so bad.\nTLDR: Can Iwisa be used to make tortillas like Maseca?"

Razor sharp and I've kept it that way. My complaint is the spine is a perfect square edge, so using a pinch grip for any extended period of time can be quite painful on the first finger.\nGiven these knives are a popular choice for professional chefs, something seems off. Is it my particular knife, or something else? Anyone else experienced this with the Mighty Mac?\nI don't have this issue with my globals, or other knife brands I own."

The final result separated into a thick, clumpy sediment and a thin, watery liquid.\nHere was my exact process:\nSoaked 1 glass of dry soybeans for 12 hours. They doubled in size.\nBlended the 2 glasses of soaked beans with 3 glasses of water. Strained through a fine mesh sieve.\nTook the leftover pulp, blended it with another 2 glasses of water. Strained that and combined all the liquid milk.\nCooking: I put the raw milk in a pot and brought it to a boil. It took about 10 minutes. Once it was boiling, I reduced the heat to medium low and let it cook for another 10 minutes.\nThe Result: During or after cooking, it completely separated. It looks like curds and whey.\nWhat's the most likely cause for this separation? Were the beans fermented and became acidic and milk eventually curdled, due to prolonged soak? Was my cooking method too aggressive? Is my water to bean ratio off?\nAny tips for my next attempt would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
